<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
1.<br />
The Internet is America’s most important platform for economic growth, innovation, <br />
competition, free expression, and broadband investment and deployment.  As a “general purpose <br />technology,” the Internet has been, and remains to date, the preeminent 21st century engine for innovation <br />and the economic and social benefits that follow. These benefits flow, in large part, from the open, end-<br />to-end architecture of the Internet, which is characterized by low barriers to entry for developers of new <br />content, applications, services, and devices and a consumer-demand-driven marketplace for their <br />products. As the Commission explained in its 2010 <i>Open Internet Order</i>, the Internet’s open architecture <br />allows innovators and consumers at the edges of the network “to create and determine the success or <br />failure of content, applications, services and devices,” without requiring permission from the broadband <br />provider to reach end users.1  As an open platform, it fosters diversity and it enables people to build <br />communities.<br />
2.<br />
We start with a fundamental question:  What is the right public policy to ensure that the <br />
Internet remains open?  This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice), and the comment process that <br />follows, will turn on this fundamental question.  <br />
3.<br />
Today, there are no legally enforceable rules by which the Commission can stop <br />
broadband providers from limiting Internet openness.  This Notice begins the process of closing that gap, <br />by proposing to reinstitute the no-blocking rule adopted in 2010 and creating a new rule that would bar <br />commercially unreasonable actions from threatening Internet openness (as well as enhancing the <br />transparency rule that is currently in effect). <br />
4.<br />
The goal of this proceeding is to find the best approach to protecting and promoting <br />
Internet openness.  Per the blueprint offered by the D.C. Circuit in its decision in <i>Verizon v. FCC</i>, the <br />Commission proposes to rely on section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996<i>.</i>2<i>  </i>At the same time, <br />the Commission will seriously consider the use of Title II of the Communications Act as the basis for <br />legal authority.  This Notice seeks comment on the benefits of both section 706 and Title II, including the <br />benefits of one approach over the other.  Under all available sources of legal authority (including also <br />Title III for mobile services), the Commission seeks comment on the best ways to define, prevent and <br />punish the practices that threaten an open Internet.  We emphasize in this Notice that the Commission <br />recognizes that both section 706 and Title II are viable solutions and seek comment on their potential use. <br />
5.<br />
It is important to always remember that the Internet is a collection of networks, not a <br />
single network. And that means that each broadband provider can either add to the benefits that the <br />Internet delivers to Americans—by maintaining Internet openness and by extending the reach of <br />broadband networks—or it can threaten those benefits—by restricting its customers from the Internet and <br />preventing edge providers from reaching consumers over robust, fast and continuously improving <br />networks.  This is a real threat, not merely a hypothetical concern. <br />
6.<br />
In its 2010 <i>Order</i>, the Commission found that providers of broadband Internet access <br />
service had three types of incentives to limit Internet openness.  First, broadband providers may have <br />economic incentives to block or disadvantage a particular edge provider or class of edge <br />
                                                     <br />
1 <i>Preserving the Open Internet</i>, GN Docket No. 09-191, WC Docket No. 07-52, Report and Order, 25 FCC Rcd <br />17905, 17910, para. 13 (2010) (<i>Open Internet Order </i>or <i>Order</i>), <i>aff’d in part</i>, <i>vacated and remanded in part sub <br />nom. Verizon v. FCC</i>, 740 F.3d 623 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  Among other examples, the Commission cited Sir Tim <br />Berners-Lee, who—25 years ago—needed neither permission nor approvals from network operators to invent the <br />World Wide Web using existing Internet layer and transport protocols.  <i>Id.<br /></i>2 Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, § 706, 110 Stat. 56, 153 (1996) (<i>1996 <br />Act</i>), as amended in relevant part by the Broadband Data Improvement Act (BDIA), Pub. L. No. 110-385, 122 Stat. <br />4096 (2008), is now codified in Title 47, Chapter 12 of the United States Code.  <i>See </i>47 U.S.C. § 1301 <i>et seq</i>.<br />

providers.3 Second, broadband providers may have incentives to increase revenues by charging edge <br />providers for access or prioritized access to the broadband provider’s end users.4 In particular, excessive <br />fees could reduce edge provider entry, suppress innovation, and depress consumer demand.5 Third, if <br />providers could profitably charge edge providers they would have an incentive “to degrade or decline to <br />increase the quality of service they provide to non-prioritized traffic.”6<br />
7.<br />
Those threats are even more important today because Americans and American <br />
businesses have become even more dependent on the Internet.  For example, according to the Pew <br />Research Internet Project, as of January 2014, 87 percent of Americans used the Internet, compared to <br />14 percent in 1995.7  And it is a critical route of commerce, supporting an e-commerce marketplace that <br />now boasts U.S. revenues of $263.3 billion.8<br />
8.<br />
Of particular concern are threats to American innovation. In “the end-to-end architecture, <br />
different economic actors can independently choose their innovation projects.”9 Innovation is the chief <br />driver of American economic growth, which means that all Americans lose if the opportunity to innovate <br />is curbed.  For example, an economic study originally released in February 2012 and updated in July 2013 <br />reported that the app economy is responsible for roughly 752,000 jobs in the United States, which is an <br />increase from zero in 2007 when the iPhone was introduced.10 But equally important are the jobs that <br />could be—but might not be—created if edge innovation and investment were to be chilled by doubt that <br />the Internet will remain open or, even worse, if openness were defeated. <br />
9.<br />
Although the Commission has emphasized for almost a decade the importance of legally<br />
enforceable standards, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has twice <br />invalidated the Commission’s attempts, most recently in <i>Verizon v. FCC</i>, decided this January.11 It is in <br />the absence of these protections for the open Internet that the Commission must act to ensure that new <br />legally enforceable rules are put in place.  That is a gap that must be closed as quickly as possible.<br />
10.<br />
The remainder of the Notice proceeds as follows.  First, we generally propose to retain <br />
the definitions and scope of the 2010 rules. Second, we tentatively conclude that the Commission should <br />enhance the transparency rule that was upheld by the D.C. Circuit so that the public and the Commission <br />have the benefit of sunlight on broadband provider actions and to ensure that consumers and edge <br />
                                                     <br />

In the <br /><i>Open Internet Order</i>, the Commission defined “end user” as any individual or entity that uses a broadband Internet <br />access service and sometimes used “subscriber” or “consumer” to refer to those end users that subscribe to a <br />particular broadband Internet access service. “Edge provider” was defined as referring to content, application, <br />service, and device providers, because they generally operate at the edge rather than the core of the network.

providers—indeed, the Internet community at large—have the information they need to understand the <br />services they are receiving and to monitor practices that could undermine the open Internet.  Third, we <br />tentatively conclude that the Commission should adopt the text of the no-blocking rule from the <i>Open <br />Internet Order </i>with a revised rationale, in order to ensure that all end users and edge providers can enjoy <br />the use of robust, fast and dynamic Internet access.  Fourth, and where conduct would otherwise be <br />permissible under the no-blocking rule, we propose to create a separate screen that requires broadband <br />providers to adhere to an enforceable legal standard of commercially reasonable practices, asking how <br />harm can best be identified and prohibited and whether certain practices, like paid prioritization, should <br />be barred altogether. Fifth, we propose a multi-faceted dispute resolution process to provide effective <br />access for end users, edge providers, and broadband network providers alike and the creation of an <br />ombudsperson to act as a watchdog to represent the interests of consumers, start-ups, and small <br />businesses.  Sixth, and finally, we ask how either section 706 or Title II (or other sources of legal <br />authority such as Title III for mobile services) could be applied to ensure that the Internet remains open.<br />

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
11.<br />
Today’s Notice rests upon over a decade of consistent action by the Commission to <br />
protect and promote the Internet as an open platform for innovation, competition, economic growth, and<br />free expression.  At the core of all of these Commission efforts has been a view endorsed by four <br />Chairmen and a majority of the Commission’s members in office during that time:  That FCC oversight is <br />essential to protect the openness that is critical to the Internet’s success.  In recognition of this, the <br />Commission has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to safeguarding that openness. <br />
12.<br />
In 2004, former Chairman Michael Powell first articulated basic guiding principles for <br />
preserving Internet freedom in an address at Silicon Flatirons.  Chairman Powell recognized that <br />“consumers’ hunger for an ever-expanding array of high-value content, applications, and devices”12<br />fueled investment in broadband networks as the “impressive generators of economic growth, innovation, <br />and empowerment.”  He explained that “ensuring that consumers can obtain and use the content, <br />applications and devices they want . . . is critical to unlocking the vast potential of the broadband <br />Internet.”13<br />
13.<br />
A year later, reinforcing Chairman Powell’s guidance, the Commission unanimously <br />
approved the <i>Internet Policy Statement </i>setting forth four general Internet policy principles intended “[t]o <br />encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the <br />Internet.”14  Specifically, subject to “reasonable network management,”15 the principles entitle consumers <br />to (1) “access the lawful Internet content of their choice;” (2) “run applications and use services of their <br />choice, subject to the needs of law enforcement;” (3) “connect their choice of legal devices that do not <br />
                                                     <br />

harm the network;” and (4) enjoy “competition among network providers, application and service <br />providers, and content providers.”16    <br />
14.<br />
The Commission incorporated these open Internet principles in a series of merger <br />
proceedings.  In 2005, the Commission conditioned approval of the SBC/AT&amp;T and Verizon/MCI <br />mergers on the merged entities’ compliance with the <i>Internet Policy Statement</i>.17  Although the <br />Commission did not adopt any formal open Internet conditions on the Adelphia/Time Warner/Comcast<br />transactions, the Commission made clear that its <i>Internet Policy Statement </i>“contains principles against <br />which the conduct of Comcast [and] Time Warner . . . can be measured.”18  So too, in 2006, the <br />Commission accepted the AT&amp;T and BellSouth commitment to “maintain a neutral network and neutral <br />routing in [the merged entity’s] wireline broadband Internet access service,” as a formal condition of the <br />merger.19  Likewise, in the 2011 Comcast-NBCU merger, the Commission adopted the commitments of <br />the merged entity to not “prioritize affiliated Internet content over unaffiliated Internet content . . . [or] <br />treat affiliated network traffic differently from unaffiliated network traffic” as well as to comply with the <br />Commission’s open Internet rules, regardless of the effect of “any judicial challenge” affecting those <br />rules.20  <br />
15.<br />
The Commission likewise incorporated openness principles for mobile services, adopting<br />
an open platform requirement for licensees in the Upper 700 MHz C Block in 2007.21  Specifically, the <br />rules require Upper 700 MHz C-Block licensees to allow customers, device manufacturers, third-party <br />application developers, and others to use or develop the devices and applications of their choice for Upper <br />                                                     <br />

700 MHz C-Block networks, provided those devices and applications meet all applicable regulatory <br />requirements and comply with reasonable conditions related to management of the wireless network (i.e., <br />do not cause harm to the network).  Further, the Commission prohibited Upper 700 MHz C-Block <br />licensees from disabling features or functionality in handsets where such action is not related to <br />reasonable network management and protection, or compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.22  <br />
16.<br />
Also in 2007, the Commission unanimously adopted the <i>Broadband Industry Practices </i><br />
<i>Notice of Inquiry</i>, explaining that vigilance and a willingness to act were necessary to keep the Internet <br />open.23  The <i>Broadband Industry Practices Notice </i>specifically sought comment on whether the <i>Internet<br />Policy Statement </i>should be amended or expanded.24  <br />
17.<br />
Meanwhile, the Commission applied open Internet principles in the context of particular <br />
enforcement proceedings.  Just before the Commission adopted the <i>Internet Policy Statement</i>, the <br />Enforcement Bureau had entered into a consent decree with Madison River Communications, a telephone <br />company and provider of digital subscriber line (DSL) service, arising from complaints by Vonage that <br />Madison River was blocking ports that were typically used by Vonage customers to make Voice over <br />Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone calls.25  The consent decree required Madison River to stop blocking <br />VoIP ports and refrain from otherwise inhibiting customers from using the VoIP applications of their <br />choice.26<br />
18.<br />
In 2007, several parties filed complaints with the Commission alleging that Comcast was <br />
interfering with its customers’ use of peer-to-peer applications in violation of the <i>Internet Policy <br />Statement.</i>27<i>  </i>Such applications allow users to share large files directly with one another without going <br />through a central server, but also can consume significant amounts of bandwidth.  In response, Comcast <br />asserted that its conduct was a reasonable network management practice necessary to ease congestion.28  <br />The Commission disagreed and, in a 2008 Order, concluded that the company’s practice “contravene[d]<br />. . . federal policy” by “significantly imped[ing] consumers’ ability to access the content and use the <br />applications of their choice.”29  As the Commission explained, Comcast’s “practice unduly squelch[ed]<br />

the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible Internet,” harm that was further compounded by <br />Comcast’s failure to disclose its practice to its customers.30  In the <i>Comcast Order</i>, the Commission <br />asserted ancillary jurisdiction under Title I of the Communications Act and concluded that it could <br />resolve the dispute through adjudication rather than rulemaking.31  <br />
19.<br />
Comcast challenged that decision in the D.C. Circuit, arguing (among other things) that <br />
the Commission lacked authority to prohibit a broadband Internet service provider from engaging in <br />discriminatory practices that violate the four principles the Commission announced in 2005.32  On April 6, <br />2010, the D.C. Circuit granted Comcast’s petition for review and vacated the Commission’s enforcement <br />decision.  As to section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the court noted that the agency had <br />previously interpreted section 706 as not constituting a grant of authority and held that the Commission <br />was bound by that interpretation for purposes of the case.33<br />
20.<br />
While the Comcast case was pending, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed <br />
Rulemaking seeking comment on whether the Commission should codify the four principles stated in the <br /><i>Internet Policy Statement</i>, plus proposed nondiscrimination and transparency rules, all subject to <br />reasonable network management. 34  <br />
21.<br />
In December 2010, the Commission released the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, adopting three <br />
basic rules grounded in the Commission’s prior decisions and broadly accepted Internet norms.35  First, <br />the <i>Order </i>imposed a transparency rule, requiring both fixed and mobile providers to “publically disclose <br />accurate information regarding the network management practices, performance, and commercial terms” <br />of their broadband Internet access service.36  The rule specified that such disclosures be “sufficient for <br />consumers to make informed choices regarding the use of such services and for content, application, <br />service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings.”37  Second, the <i>Order <br /></i>adopted anti-blocking requirements.  The rule barred fixed providers from blocking “lawful content, <br />applications, services, or non-harmful devices subject to reasonable network management.”38  It <br />prohibited mobile providers from blocking “consumers from accessing lawful websites,” as well as <br />“applications that compete with the provider’s voice or video telephony services,” subject to “reasonable <br />network management.”39  Third, the <i>Order </i>adopted an anti-discrimination rule for fixed providers, barring <br />them from “unreasonably discriminat[ing] in transmitting lawful network traffic,” subject to “reasonable <br />network management.”40  <br />

Verizon challenged the <i>Open Internet Order </i>in the D.C. Circuit on several grounds.41  It <br />
argued that the Commission lacked statutory authority to adopt the rules, that the blocking and non-<br />discrimination rules violated the Communications Act by imposing common carriage regulation on an <br />information service, that the <i>Order </i>was arbitrary and capricious, and that the rules violated the First and <br />Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  <br />
23.<br />
On January 14, 2014, the D.C. Circuit ruled on Verizon’s challenge to the <i>Open Internet </i><br />
<i>Order</i>.42 As discussed further below, the court upheld the Commission’s reading that sections 706(a) and <br />(b) of the Telecommunications Act grant the Commission affirmative authority to encourage and <br />accelerate the deployment of broadband capability to all Americans through, among other things, <br />measures that promote competition in the local telecommunications market or remove barriers to <br />infrastructure investment.43  The court further held that the Commission could utilize that section 706 <br />authority to regulate broadband Internet access service.44  It concluded that the Commission had <br />adequately justified the adoption of open Internet rules by finding that such rules would preserve and <br />facilitate the “virtuous circle” of innovation, demand for Internet services, and deployment of broadband <br />infrastructure and that, absent such rules, broadband providers would have the incentive and ability to <br />inhibit that deployment.45  The court therefore rejected Verizon’s challenge to the transparency rule.46  <br />However, the court struck down the “anti-blocking” and “anti-discrimination” rules, explaining that the<br />Commission had chosen an impermissible mechanism by which to implement its legitimate goals. <br />Specifically, the court held that the Commission had imposed <i>per se </i>common carriage requirements on <br />providers of Internet access services.47  Such treatment was impermissible because the Commission had <br />classified fixed broadband Internet access service as an information service, not a telecommunications <br />service, and had classified mobile broadband Internet access service as a private mobile service rather <br />than a commercial mobile service.48  The court remanded the case to the Commission for further <br />proceedings consistent with its opinion.<br />
24.<br />
Today, we respond directly to that remand and propose to adopt enforceable rules of the <br />
road, consistent with the court’s opinion, to protect and promote the open Internet.  As the above history <br />demonstrates, our action builds on the foundation begun under Chairman Powell, continued under<br />Chairmen Martin and Genachowski, and reinforced by a decade of Commission policy.   <br />

<p><b>An Open Internet Promotes Innovation, Competition, Free Expression, and <br />Infrastructure Deployment</b></p>
25.<br />
In the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, the Commission reiterated the conclusion underlying its prior <br />
policies—that the Internet’s openness promotes innovation, investment, competition, free expression and <br />other national broadband goals.49  The Commission also found that the Internet’s openness is critical to its <br />ability to serve as a platform for speech and civic engagement and can help close the digital divide by<br />facilitating the development of diverse content, applications, and services.50  Further, the <i>Order </i>found that <br />the benefits of Internet openness—increased consumer choice, freedom of expression, and innovation—<br />applied to end users accessing the Internet using mobile services as well as fixed services.51<br />

In the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, the Commission specifically found that the Internet’s <br />
openness enabled a “virtuous circle of innovation in which new uses of the network—including new <br />content, applications, services, and devices—lead to increased end-user demand for broadband, which <br />drives network improvements, which in turn lead to further innovative network uses.”52  For example, the <br />Commission explained that innovative streaming video applications and independent sources of video <br />content have spurred end-user demand, which, in turn, has led to network investments and increased <br />broadband deployment.53  By contrast, the Commission reasoned, “[r]estricting edge providers’ ability to <br />reach end users, and limiting end users’ ability to choose which edge providers to patronize, would reduce <br />the rate of innovation at the edge and, in turn, the likely rate of improvements to network <br />infrastructure.”54  As discussed further below, the Commission found that, despite the advantages of the <br />virtuous circle, broadband providers have short-term incentives to limit openness, generating harms to <br />edge providers and users, among others.55 Thus, the risk of broadband provider practices that may reward <br />them in the short term but over the long run erode Internet openness threatens to slow or even break the <br />virtuous circle—chilling entry and innovation by edge providers, impeding competition in many sectors, <br />dampening consumer demand, and deterring broadband deployment—in ways that may be irreversible or <br />very costly to undo.  Also, innovation that does not occur due to lack of Internet openness may be hard to <br />detect.<br />

The <i>Open Internet Order </i>acknowledged that there were tradeoffs to consider in adopting <br />
the 2010 rules.56  The Commission concluded, however, that any small costs of imposing the rules were<br />outweighed by the positive effect on network investment from the preservation of the openness that drives <br />the virtuous circle, as well as the increased certainty in continued openness under the rules.57<br />
28.<br />
The D.C. Circuit held that “the Commission [had] more than adequately supported and <br />
explained its conclusion that edge provider innovation leads to the expansion and improvement of <br />broadband infrastructure.”58  The court also found “reasonable and grounded in substantial evidence” the <br />Commission’s finding that Internet openness fosters the edge provider innovation that drives the virtuous <br />circle.59  <br />
29.<br />
We believe that these findings, made by the Commission in 2010 and upheld by the <br />
court, remain valid.  If anything, the remarkable increases in investment and innovation seen in recent <br />years—while the rules were in place—appear to have borne out much of the Commission’s view.60  Both <br />within the network and at its edges, investment and innovation have flourished while the open Internet <br />rules were in force.  <br />

According to a June 2013 report by the White House Office of Science and Technology <br />
Policy, for example, nearly $250 billion in private capital has been invested in U.S. wired and wireless <br />broadband networks since 2009.61  USTelecom reports that broadband capital expenditures have risen <br />steadily, from $64 billion in 2009 to $68 billion in 2012.62  Wireline providers alone invested $25 billion <br />in 2012.63  And venture capital financing of “Internet-specific” businesses has doubled in the past four <br />years, from $3.5 billion in 2009 to $7.1 billion in 2013.64 Annual investment in U.S. wireless networks <br />grew more than 40 percent between 2009 and 2012, from $21 billion to $30 billion, and exceeds <br />investment by the major oil and gas or auto companies.65<br />

services in the United States.  In April 2010, Apple released the first version of the iPad, which launched<br />the tablet market.66  The number of tablet users in the United States has increased from 9.7 million in <br />2010 to almost 70 million by the end of 2012, and is projected to grow to more than 160 million <br />(approximately 50 percent of the U.S. population) by 2016.67 In 2013, over $1 billion in venture capital <br />funding was invested in mobile media startups,68 and overall app use in 2013 posted 115 percent year-<br />over-year growth.69  According to CTIA, in 2012 there were more than 20 independent non-carrier mobile <br />application stores, offering over 3.5 million apps for 14 different operating systems.70  The Wall Street <br />Journal reported in March 2013 that Apple and Google each offered about 700,000 apps, and that <br />application sales were approaching $25 billion.71<br />
32.<br />
Finally, we have seen tremendous growth in the online voice and video markets.  The <br />
number of hours Americans spend watching video over the Internet has grown 70 percent since June <br />2010.72  Between 2010 and 2013, revenues from online video services grew 175 percent, from $1.86 <br />billion to $5.12 billion.73  Real-time entertainment (that is, programming that is viewed as it is delivered, <br />such as video streamed by Netflix and Hulu) grew from 42.7 percent of the downstream fixed access <br />traffic at peak time (generally 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.) in 2010 to 67 percent of the downstream fixed <br />access traffic at peak time by September 2013.74 VoIP usage has similarly continued to increase.  The <br />number of global over-the-top mobile VoIP subscribers increased by 550 percent in 2012.75<br />

technologies capable of providing broadband speeds of 25 Mbps up to 1 Gigabit, rural America and even <br />some parts of urban America are falling farther and farther behind.  Recent data suggest that a majority of <br />Americans living in urban areas (64 percent) have access to at least 25 Mbps/10 Mbps service, while only <br />a substantial minority of Americans residing in rural areas (only 21 percent) have access to that same 25 <br />Mbps/10 Mbps service.76  We are similarly concerned as to whether advanced networks are being <br />deployed to all Americans in urban areas, as the construction of new networks, especially competitive <br />networks, is an outcome that must be encouraged.<br />
34.<br />
In light of developments in the Internet ecosystem since 2010, we wish to refresh the <br />
record on the importance of protecting and promoting an open Internet.  We seek comment on the current <br />role of the Internet’s openness in facilitating innovation, economic growth, free expression, civic <br />engagement, competition, and broadband investment and deployment.  Particularly, we seek comment on <br />the role the open Internet rules have had in investment in the broadband marketplace—networks and edge <br />providers alike.  We are similarly interested in understanding the role that the open Internet may play in <br />the promotion of competition or in identifying barriers to infrastructure investment that an open Internet <br />may eliminate or lessen.  We also seek comment on the role that the open Internet has for public <br />institutions, such as public and school libraries, research libraries, and colleges and universities.77  <br />
35.<br />
Additionally, we seek comment on the impact of the openness of the Internet on free <br />
expression and civic engagement.  For example, the percentage of Americans who use the Internet <br />reached 87 percent in 2014—an increase of 8 percent from 2010, the year in which the <i>Open Internet<br />Order </i>was adopted—marking “explosive adoption” that has had “wide-ranging impacts on everything <br />from: the way people get, share and create news . . . the way they learn; the nature of their political <br />activity; their interactions with government; the style and scope of their communications with friends and <br />family; and the way they organize in communities.”78  In light of the important role that the Internet now <br />plays as a vehicle for communication of all sorts—both for consumers and content providers—how <br />should we consider the potential impact on social and personal expression of an Internet whose openness <br />was not protected?  For example, would there be particular impacts on political speech, on the ability of <br />consumers to use the Internet to express themselves, or on the Internet’s role as a “marketplace of ideas” <br />that serves the interests of democracy in general, serving even the interests of those Americans who listen <br />even if they do not actively speak?79  Are there other ways in which we should understand free-expression <br />interests and whether they may be impaired by a lack of openness?80<br />
                                                     <br />
76 We estimate broadband deployment by relying on the broadband deployment data collected by National <br />Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the states, in coordination with the Commission, <br />as part of the State Broadband Initiative (SBI) and called “SBI Data.”  Department of Commerce, NTIA, State <br />Broadband Data and Development Grant Program, Docket No. 0660-ZA29, Notice of Funds Availability, 74 Fed. <br />Reg. 32545 (July 8, 2009), <a title="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/fr_broadbandmappingnofa_090708.pdf" href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/fr_broadbandmappingnofa_090708.pdf">http://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/fr_broadbandmappingnofa_090708.pdf</a>.  <br />77 <i>See, e.g.</i>, Letter of Emily Sheketoff, ALA Washington Office, <i>et al. </i>to Thomas Wheeler, Chairman, Federal <br />Communications Commission (filed Feb. 13, 2014). <br />78 Susannah Fox &amp; Lee Rainie, The Web at 25 in the U.S. 4, Pew Research Internet Project (2014)  <br /><a title="http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2014/02/PIP_25th-anniversary-of-the-Web_0227141.pdf" href="http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2014/02/PIP_25th-anniversary-of-the-Web_0227141.pdf">http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2014/02/PIP_25th-anniversary-of-the-Web_0227141.pdf</a>.  The Pew Research <br />Internet Project also reports that 73% of Internet users say that it would be somewhat hard or very hard to give up <br />the Internet and that 56% of users say that “they have seen an online group come together to held a person or a <br />community solve a problem.” <i>Id. </i>at 7, 22.<br />79 <i>See Abrams v.

36.<br />
At the same time, we are mindful of the possible tradeoffs the Commission recognized at <br />
the time it adopted the <i>Open Internet Order</i>.81  When it adopted the rules in 2010, the Commission’s <br />primary focus was on the market between broadband providers and their end-user subscribers.  The record <br />contained no evidence of U.S. broadband providers engaging in pay-for-priority arrangements, in which <br />the broadband provider would agree with a third party to directly or indirectly prioritize some traffic over <br />other traffic to reach the provider’s subscribers.82  As such, the Commission found that such arrangements <br />would be a “significant departure from historical and current practice.”83   <br />
37.<br />
In the years since, this second side of the market—between broadband providers and <br />
edge providers or other third parties—has gotten increasing attention.  In its arguments challenging the <br /><i>Order</i>, Verizon expressed interest in pursuing commercial agreements with edge providers to govern the <br />carriage of the edge providers’ traffic.84  We also note that such arrangements between broadband and <br />edge providers have begun to emerge.  In January 2014, for example, AT&amp;T launched a new sponsored <br />data service, in which an edge provider enters an agreement with AT&amp;T to sponsor and pay for data <br />charges resulting from eligible uses of the sponsor’s content by an AT&amp;T mobile subscriber.85  <br />
38.<br />
We seek comment on the potential for, and development of, new business arrangements<br />
in the market between broadband providers and edge providers.  What does the multi-sided market look <br />like, and what are its effects on Internet openness?  Do some types of broadband and edge provider <br />arrangements (or aspects of such arrangements) raise greater concerns about Internet openness than <br />others?86    <br />

<p><b>Broadband Providers Have the Incentive and Ability to Limit Openness</b></p>
39.<br />
The <i>Open Internet Order </i>found that broadband Internet providers had the incentives and <br />
ability to limit Internet openness, and that they had done so in the past.87  And the D.C. Circuit found that <br />the Commission “adequately supported and explained” that absent open Internet rules, “broadband <br />providers represent a threat to Internet openness and could act in ways that would ultimately inhibit the <br />speed and extent of future broadband deployment.”88 As discussed further below, we seek to update the <br />record to reflect marketplace, technical, and other changes since the 2010 <i>Open Internet Order </i>was <br />adopted that may have either exacerbated or mitigated broadband providers’ incentives and ability to limit <br />Internet openness.  We seek general comment on the Commission’s approach to analyzing broadband <br />providers’ incentives and ability to engage in practices that would limit the open Internet, as well as more <br />targeted comment as addressed below.<br />

As noted above, the Commission has pursued policies to safeguard Internet openness for <br />
over a decade.  Thus, while the number of existing cases has been relatively few, we believe this to be <br />primarily due to the fact that the Commission has had policies in place during the period in question that <br />it has been ready to enforce.89  This is different from the experience under the European legal framework, <br />which for the most part has not contained rules or policies prohibiting blocking and discriminatory <br />practices like the Commission’s open Internet regulatory policies.90  In the absence of such rules and <br />policies, commenters note more instances of broadband providers engaging in some level of restriction in <br />Europe than the Commission has witnessed in the United States under its open Internet policies.91  For <br />example, a survey conducted by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications <br />(BEREC) shows that European Internet service providers reported engaging in specific restrictions such <br />as traffic degradation as well as blocking and throttling when accessing “specific applications (such as <br />gaming, streaming, e-mail or instant messaging service) and, to a much lesser extent, when [accessing] <br />specific content and application providers.”92  We seek comment on this analysis and ask whether there is <br />some other explanation to account for this phenomenon.  <br />
41.<br />
We also note that concerns related to the open Internet rules and norms have continued to <br />

<p><b>Economic Incentives and Ability</b></p>
42.<br />
In the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, the Commission found that providers of broadband Internet <br />
access service had multiple incentives to limit Internet openness.  The <i>Order </i>concluded that the threat of <br />broadband provider interference with Internet openness would be exacerbated by—but did not depend <br />on—such providers possessing market power over potential subscribers in their choice of broadband <br />provider.  However, the Commission found that most residential customers have only one or two options <br />for wireline broadband Internet access service, increasing the risk of market power, and found the future <br />of mobile Internet access service as a competing substitute remained unclear.95  Moreover, the <br />Commission emphasized that customers may incur significant costs in switching from one provider to <br />another, thus creating “terminating monopolies” for content providers needing high-speed broadband <br />service to reach end users.96<br />
43.<br />
The D.C. Circuit found that the Commission’s assessment of broadband providers’<br />
incentives and economic ability to threaten Internet openness was not just supported by the record but <br />also grounded in “common sense and economic reality.”97  It affirmed the Commission’s conclusions that <br />vertically integrated broadband providers have incentives to interfere with competitive services and that <br />broadband providers generally have incentives to accept fees from edge providers.98 And the court cited <br />with approval the Commission’s conclusion that a broadband provider would be unlikely to fully account <br />for the harms resulting from such practices.99  The court also upheld the agency’s conclusion that such <br />incentives could “produce widespread interference with the Internet’s openness in the absence of <br />Commission action.”100  Finally, the court agreed that the Commission need not engage in a market power <br />analysis to justify its rules, explaining that broadband providers’ ability to block or disadvantage edge <br />providers depended on “end users not being fully responsive to the imposition of such restrictions,” not <br />

on “the sort of market concentration that would enable them to impose substantial price increases on end <br />users.”101<br />
44.<br />
We seek to update the record underlying the <i>Open Internet Order</i>’s conclusion that <br />
broadband providers have incentives and the economic ability to limit Internet openness in ways that <br />threaten to weaken or break the virtuous circle.  How have changes in the marketplace or technology <br />since 2010 affected broadband providers incentives and economic ability to engage in such practices?  To <br />what extent do broadband providers today have economic incentives and mechanisms to block or <br />disadvantage a particular edge provider or class of edge providers?  To what extent do vertically<br />integrated providers have particularized incentives to discriminate—on price, quality, or other bases—in <br />favor of affiliated products? What are broadband providers’ incentives to increase revenues by charging <br />edge providers for access or prioritized access to the broadband provider’s end users?  Are there features <br />of the Internet ecosystem that facilitate or impede a broadband provider’s ability to internalize the harms<br />caused by practices that limit openness?  Are there justifications for charging fees to edge providers that <br />were not present in 2010?  We seek comment on these and other economic incentives and abilities that <br />broadband providers may have to limit openness.102<br />
45.<br />
We generally seek comment on what economic tools broadband providers utilize to <br />
manage traffic on their networks.  Broadband providers may address traffic management through <br />commercial terms and conditions on end users, such as pricing for different levels of throughput or <br />through the use of “data caps.”  To what extent and in what ways do broadband providers use such tools <br />to manage traffic, such as by excluding certain content from such an end user data cap?103  Might these <br />tools be used to exploit market power or reduce competition? <br />
46.<br />
In addition, we seek comment on end users’ ability to switch providers if a particular <br />
broadband service does not meet their needs.  What is the extent of switching costs, and how do switching<br />costs affect the incentives and economic ability of providers to limit Internet openness?104  As discussed <br />in the <i>Open Internet Order </i>and affirmed by the D.C. Circuit, both edge providers seeking access to end <br />users and end users seeking access to edge providers are subject to the gatekeeper effect of a retail <br />broadband provider.105  Absent multi-homing, an end user has only one option to reach a given edge <br />provider’s content.106  To reach any given end user, an edge provider must ensure that it or its broadband<br />provider can reach the end user’s broadband provider.  Terms and conditions, price, or lack of other <br />broadband providers, among other factors, can raise switching costs to the point where switching is <br />inefficient, infeasible, or even impossible.107  We seek comment on these conclusions.  To what extent do <br />                                                     <br />

consumers face significant switching costs in choosing to change broadband access providers?  Which <br />services, if any, are most vulnerable to a broadband provider’s market power because of the inability to <br />effectively reach subscribers through other means?  To the extent that such switching costs exist, to what <br />extent, if any, are they exacerbated by additional factors, such as the difficulty consumers may have in <br />effectively monitoring the extent to which edge providers have difficulty reaching them, the number of <br />effective substitutes a consumer may have among broadband providers, or the impact of bundled pricing <br />and switching costs attached to the purchase or use of bundled services, such as a combined offering of <br />broadband access along with video services and voice telephony?  Would all likely alternatives have <br />similar incentives to limit openness, possibly for a different set of services?  We also seek comment on an <br />end user’s ability to switch broadband providers in response to specific broadband provider practice, for <br />example a broadband provider’s decision to charge an edge provider to reach the customer.  Are <br />switching costs relevant to an edge provider’s interaction with a broadband provider and, if so, how?<br />Finally, what are the implications when consumers have no ability to switch providers because there is <br />only one provider offering service to the consumer’s location?<br />
47.<br />
We also seek comment on the state of competition in broadband Internet access service, <br />
and its effect on providers’ incentives to limit openness.  We seek comment on the appropriate view of <br />whether broadband services with substantially different technical characteristics are competitive <br />substitutes.  For example, how should we regard the ability of DSL service with speeds of, for example,<br />3 Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream to constrain conduct by a provider of high-speed broadband <br />with speeds of, for example, 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps upstream (or higher)?  How should we <br />regard the geography of broadband competition?  From an end user’s point of view, do national practices <br />or market shares have any impact on edge providers, without regard to the definition of a geographic <br />market?<br />
48.<br />
In the fixed broadband context, we have seen evidence of limited choice between <br />
broadband providers in many areas of the country.  As the speed threshold increases to 6 Mbps <br />downstream and 1.5 Mbps upstream, the number of households that are located in census tracts with at <br />least three providers that report serving customers at those higher speeds dips down to a mere <br />34 percent.108   In many areas of the country, with respect to fixed Internet access, consumers may have <br />only limited options, i.e., one or two fixed providers available.109 We seek comment on the extent to <br />which commercial practices differ in places where consumers have only one choice of a wireline <br />broadband provider, two choices, or more than two choices.  We therefore also seek comment as to <br />whether increased spectrum availability and technological developments in the mobile broadband <br />marketplace, e.g., growth in 4G/ LTE availability, would affect the market power of fixed broadband <br />providers. 110  <br />
49.<br />
We further seek general comment on our approach towards analyzing broadband provider <br />
incentives.  Under the Commission’s reading, which the court upheld, our section 706 authority is not <br />                                                     <br />

predicated on a finding of market power, specifically, that broadband providers need not be found to be<br />“benefiting from the sort of market concentration that would enable them to impose substantial price <br />increases on end users.”111   Nor do we believe that the open Internet concerns described above solely <br />arise in markets where broadband providers possess market power over subscriber prices.  We recognize, <br />however, that the presence or absence of market power—over broadband subscriptions, over end users <br />once they have chosen a broadband provider, and over content providers who wish to reach those end <br />users—may inform an understanding of a broadband provider’s behavior in the Internet marketplace and <br />its incentives to engage in practices that limit Internet openness.  Thus, we seek comment on whether the <br />Commission should engage in a market power analysis with respect to broadband providers and, if so, <br />how we should go about that analysis.   <br />
50.<br />
We further seek comment on whether there are other economic theories that the <br />
Commission should consider to better understand and assess broadband providers’ incentives to engage in <br />practices that affect the Internet’s openness.  For example, do broadband providers have an incentive to <br />extract rents from upstream services whose price significantly exceeds the marginal cost of delivering <br />those services to an additional customer?  Are there positive network effects from widespread adoption of <br />broadband services by consumers that we should recognize?112 Do edge providers that incur significant <br />sunk costs in the delivery of their output face “lock-in” problems if they become dependent on a <br />particular pathway to their current or potential users?  In the absence of open Internet protections, would <br />those edge providers face uncertainty that would hamper their ability to attract capital?  Does the trend <br />towards the caching of content closer to end users either increase such lock-in problems or, separately, <br />limit the number of pathways by which an edge provider’s output can effectively reach current or <br />potential end users? We seek comment on whether and how other theories and new evidence may<br />supplement or supplant the original <i>Open Internet Order </i>analysis. <br />
<b>b.</b><br />
<p><b>Technical Ability</b></p>
51.<br />
The <i>Open Internet Order </i>likewise found that broadband providers have the technical <br />
ability to limit Internet openness.  As the <i>Order </i>explained, increasingly sophisticated network <br />management tools enable providers to identify and differentiate the treatment of traffic on their own <br />broadband Internet access service networks.113 The D.C. Circuit agreed, finding “little dispute that <br />broadband providers have the technological ability to distinguish between and discriminate against certain <br />types of Internet traffic.”114 We seek comment on this general conclusion and on how this ability to <br />impose restrictions on edge providers and end users has increased or decreased with further developments <br />in technology or business practices since the <i>Open Internet Order</i>.  We also seek comment on provider <br />abilities that were not identified in the <i>Open Internet Order </i>or elsewhere in this Notice, including <br />                                                     <br />
111 <i>Verizon</i>, 740 F.3d at 648.<br />112 One such model is “Metcalfe’s law” a rough empirical description of the value of a communications network, <br />where n is the number of users in a network, the total value of the network is equivalent to n(n-1) or roughly n2 when <br /><i>n </i>is large.  Carl Shapiro, Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy 184 (1999).  The precise <br />equation has been called into question, <i>see </i>Bob Briscoe et al., <i>Metcalfe’s Law is Wrong</i>, IEEE Spectrum 26-31 <br />(2006) (proposing a valuation equation of n log(n)), and we do not rely on the precise mathematical formulation of <br />the effects that it predicts.<br />113 <i>Open Internet Order</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 17923, para. 31.  We recognize that broadband providers also have the <br />ability to impact traffic and congestion in ways that go beyond the management of traffic within their networks.  In <br />particular, we understand that broadband providers also manage traffic in the context of their relationships with <br />other autonomous networks.  For example, traffic and congestion may be affected by interconnection arrangements <br />for the exchange of Internet traffic between two networks as well as CDN-type arrangements in which third parties <br />place equipment in or adjacent to the providers’ network.  As discussed in section III.B, the rules we propose today <br />reflect the scope of the 2010 <i>Open Internet Order</i>, which applied to broadband provider conduct within its own <br />network. <br />114 <i>Verizon</i>, 740 F.3d at 646.  <br />

identifying the particular ability and its relevance to this proceeding.  For example, one commenter has <br />expressed concern about broadband providers offering prioritized service in a manner that may harm rural <br />or minority end users.115 Is it technically feasible for a broadband provider to block or degrade based on <br />the location or neighborhood of the end user?  Is it likely that it would do so?  If so, how should our rules <br />address this concern?<br />
52.<br />
We seek comment on broadband providers’ ability to limit Internet openness through <br />
management of traffic on their own networks and limitations imposed on their end users.  Providers <br />generally have the ability to manage traffic and congestion on their own networks and have developed a <br />number of techniques to do so. 116 For example, a provider can use technical methods like packet <br />classification, admission control and resource reservation, rate control and traffic shaping, as well as <br />packet dropping and packet scheduling to identify and manage traffic on its network.117 Such techniques <br />may provide additional ability to discriminate in a way that is largely opaque to edge providers and end <br />users.118 We seek comment on the technical tools broadband providers can and do use to manage traffic <br />on their networks. <br />
53.<br />
The <i>Open Internet Order </i>found that providers had in fact used their ability to limit <br />
openness, citing several instances where broadband providers had been subject to Commission <br />enforcement proceedings for violating open Internet norms.119   In the <i>Order</i>, the Commission cited the <br />Madison River case, the Comcast-BitTorrent case, as well as various mobile wireless Internet providers’ <br />refusal to allow customers to use competitive payment applications, competitive voice applications, and <br />remote video applications.120  The Commission also noted other allegations of blocking or degrading <br />peer-to-peer traffic, but did not determine whether those specific practices violated open Internet <br />principles.121  The D.C. Circuit noted these examples along with the Commission’s as persuasive <br />justification for adopting open Internet rules.122  <br />

<p><b>Scope of the Rules</b></p>
54.<br />
The rules adopted in the <i>Open Internet Order </i>applied to “broadband Internet access <br />
service,” which was defined as: <br />
A mass-market retail service by wire or radio that provides the capability to transmit data <br />to and receive data from all or substantially all Internet endpoints, including any <br />capabilities that are incidental to and enable the operation of the communications service,<br />but excluding dial-up Internet access service.  This term also encompasses any service <br />that the Commission finds to be providing a functional equivalent of the service <br />described in the previous sentence, or that is used to evade the protections set forth in this <br />Part.123<br />
The <i>Order </i>defined “mass market” to mean a service marketed and sold on a standardized basis to <br />residential customers, small businesses, and other end-user customers such as schools and libraries, <br />including services purchased with support of the E-rate program.124  <br />
55.<br />
The <i>Verizon </i>decision upheld the Commission’s regulation of broadband Internet access <br />
service pursuant to section 706 and did not disturb this aspect of the <i>Open Internet Order.  </i>Thus, the <br />definition of “broadband Internet access service” remains a part of the Commission’s regulations.  We <br />tentatively conclude that we should retain this definition without modification.  We seek comment on that <br />conclusion.  The court in <i>Verizon </i>also stated that, apart from the service provided to end users, <br />“broadband providers furnish a service to edge providers, thus undoubtedly functioning as edge <br />providers’ ‘carriers.’”125  We seek comment on whether this should be identified as a separate service and, <br />if so, how we should define that service and what the regulatory consequences are, if any, of that <br />definition.<br />
56.<br />
We also seek comment on the following issues that arise in connection with the scope of <br />
the application of the rules we propose today.  <br />
57.<br />
<i>Specifically Identified Services</i>.  The <i>Open Internet Order </i>excluded certain categories of <br />
services from the definition of broadband Internet access service, such as dial-up Internet access service126<br />and multichannel video programming, the latter of which the Commission understood not to meet the <br />definition of <i>“</i>provid[ing] the capability to transmit data to and receive data from all or substantially all <br />Internet endpoints.”127  We tentatively conclude that we would maintain this approach, but seek comment <br />on whether we should change this conclusion.<br />
58.<br />
<i>Enterprise Services.  </i>The <i>Open Internet Order </i>excluded enterprise service offerings, <br />
which are typically offered to larger organizations through customized or individually negotiated <br />arrangements.128 Similarly, the <i>Open Internet Order </i>excluded virtual private network services, hosting,<br />or data storage services.  The Commission explained that such services “typically are not mass market <br />services and/or do not provide the capability to transmit data to and receive data from all or substantially <br />
(Continued from previous page)                                                            <br />openness’ in the absence of Commission action. Such a ‘problem’ is doubtless ‘industry-wide.’”) (internal citations <br />omitted).<br />123 47 C.F.R. § 8.11(a); <i>Open Internet Order</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 17932, para. 44; <i>id. </i>at 17935, para. 51 (finding that the <br />market and regulatory landscape for dial-up Internet access service differed from broadband Internet access service).<br />124 <i>Open Internet Order</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 17932, para. 45.<br />125 <i>Verizon</i>, 740 F.3d at 653.<br />126 47 C.F.R. § 8.11(a); <i>Open Internet Order</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 17932, para. 44.<br />127 <i>Open Internet Order</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 17933, para. 47.<br />128 <i>Id. </i>at 17932, para. 45.<br />

all Internet endpoints.”129 The <i>Open Internet Order </i>also established that the rules did not apply to:  <br />(1) edge provider activities, such as the provision of content on the Internet;130 and (2) premise operators, <br />entities like coffee shops or bookstores, which offer Internet access services to their patrons.131 We <br />tentatively conclude that we would maintain this approach, but seek comment on whether we should <br />change this conclusion. <br />
59.<br />
<i>Internet Traffic Exchange.</i>  The <i>Open Internet Order </i>explained that its rules did not apply <br />
beyond “the limits of a broadband provider’s control over the transmission of data to or from its <br />broadband customers.”132  In other words, the <i>Order </i>applied to a broadband provider’s use of its own <br />network but did not apply the no-blocking or unreasonable discrimination rules to the exchange of traffic <br />between networks, whether peering, paid peering, content delivery network (CDN) connection, or any <br />other form of inter-network transmission of data, as well as provider-owned facilities that are dedicated <br />solely to such interconnection. Thus, the <i>Order </i>noted that the rules were not intended “to affect existing <br />arrangements for network interconnection, including existing paid peering arrangements.”133  We <br />tentatively conclude that we should maintain this approach, but seek comment on whether we should <br />change our conclusion.  Some commenters have suggested that we should expand the scope of the open <br />Internet rules to cover issues related to traffic exchange.134  We seek comment on these suggestions.  For <br />example, how can we ensure that a broadband provider would not be able to evade our open Internet rules <br />by engaging in traffic exchange practices that would be outside the scope of the rules as proposed?<br />
60.<br />
<i>Specialized Services.  </i>In the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, the Commission recognized that <br />
broadband providers may offer “specialized services” over the same last-mile connections used to provide <br />broadband service.  The Commission stated that these services can benefit end users and spur investment, <br />but also noted the potential for specialized services to jeopardize the open Internet.135  Due to these <br />concerns, the Commission stated that it would monitor these services, but that its rules would “not <br />prevent broadband providers from offering specialized services such as facilities-based VoIP.”136  We <br />tentatively conclude that we should maintain this approach and continue to closely monitor the <br />development of specialized services to ensure that broadband providers are not using them to bypass the <br />open Internet rules or otherwise undermine a free and open Internet.  We seek comment on this tentative <br />conclusion.  How can we ensure that the specialized services exception is not used to circumvent our open <br />Internet rules?  In addition, should specialized services be addressed within the scope of the <br />“commercially reasonable” rule either as a safe harbor or among the factors for consideration?137 Should <br />the Commission define “specialized services”?138<br />
                                                     <br />
129 We also note that our rules apply only as far as the limits of a broadband provider’s control over the transmission <br />of data to or from its broadband customers.<br />130 <i>Open Internet Order</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 17934-35, para. 50.<br />131 <i>Id. </i>at 17935-36, para. 52.<br />132 <i>Id. </i>at 17933, para. 47 n.150.<br />133 <i>Id. </i>at 17944, para. 67 n.209.<br />134 <i>See, e.g.</i>, Level 3 Comments at 11-13; Cogent Comments at 31-33.<br />135 <i>Open Internet Order</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 17909, 17965-66, paras. 7, 112-14.<br />136 <i>Id. </i>at 17922-23, 17965-66, paras. 39, 112-14.<br />137 <i>See infra </i>para. 139.<br />138 The <i>Open Internet Order </i>did not formally define “specialized services,” but described them as “services that <br />share capacity with broadband Internet access service over providers’ last-mile facilities.”  <i>Open Internet Order</i>, <br />25 FCC Rcd at 17965, para. 112; <i>cf. </i>2013 OIAC Annual Report at 66-81 (identifying difficulties with defining <br />“specialized services”).  By contrast, the net neutrality rules that the European Parliament voted to adopt in April <br />2014 included a specific definition for “specialized services” as  “an electronic communications service optimised <br />

61.<br />
<i>Reasonable Network Management</i>. Although the <i>Open Internet Order</i>’s definition of <br />
broadband Internet access service did not itself address reasonable network management, the concept was <br />incorporated into each of the 2010 rules.  Specifically, the transparency rule “does not require public <br />disclosure of competitively sensitive information or information that would compromise network security <br />or undermine the efficacy of reasonable network management practices.”139   The 2010 no-blocking rule<br />was made expressly subject to “reasonable network management.”140  And the unreasonable <br />discrimination rule expressly provided for reasonable network management, which was defined as <br />follows: “A network management practice is reasonable if it is appropriate and tailored to achieving a <br />legitimate network management purpose, taking into account the particular network architecture and <br />technology of the broadband Internet access service.”141 The Commission further concluded that it would <br />“develop the scope of reasonable network management on a case-by-case basis.”142 We tentatively <br />conclude that we should continue the same approach. We seek comment on this conclusion as applied to <br />an enhanced transparency rule, our re-adoption of the no-blocking rule, and the proposal to adopt a <br />“commercially reasonable” standard.  How can we ensure that the ability of providers to engage in <br />reasonable network management is not used to circumvent the open Internet protections implemented by <br />our proposed rules?<br />
62.<br />
<i>Mobile Services. </i>The <i>Open Internet Order </i>also adopted definitions for “fixed” and <br />
“mobile” Internet access service.  It defined “fixed broadband Internet access service” to expressly <br />include “broadband Internet access service that serves end users primarily at fixed endpoints using <br />stationary equipment, . . . fixed wireless services (including fixed unlicensed wireless services), and fixed <br />satellite services.”143 It defined “mobile broadband Internet access service” as “a broadband Internet <br />access service that serves end users primarily using mobile stations.”144 The impact of this distinction <br />varied by rule.  The transparency rule applies equally to both fixed and mobile broadband Internet access <br />service.  The no-blocking rule applied a different standard to mobile broadband Internet access <br />services,145 and mobile Internet access service was excluded from the unreasonable discrimination rule. <br />We tentatively conclude that we should maintain the same approach in today’s Notice.  We seek comment <br />on this approach, which is discussed in more detail in the context of each of the proposed rules below.  <br />We recognize that there have been significant changes since 2010 in the mobile marketplace, including <br />how mobile providers manage their networks, the increased use of Wi-Fi, and the increased use of mobile <br />devices and applications.  We seek comment on whether and, if so, how these changes should lead us to <br />revisit our treatment of mobile broadband service.  Specifically, we seek comment below on whether the <br />

no-blocking rule should continue to distinguish between fixed and mobile broadband146 and whether, <br />under the commercially reasonable rule, mobile networks should be subject to the same totality-of-the-<br />circumstances test as fixed broadband.147  In addition, how should the definitions of “fixed” and “mobile” <br />services be applied to a fixed broadband provider’s commercially deployed Wi-Fi service that is made <br />available to the provider’s fixed broadband customers?  How should such changes affect our treatment of <br />reasonable network management for mobile providers?  Similarly, how should we treat mobile services <br />that are deployed and/or marketed as express substitutes for traditional telecommunications or broadband <br />services?  Finally, have there been changes in technology or the marketplace for the provision of satellite <br />broadband Internet access service that should lead the Commission to reassess how its rules should apply <br />to such services?<br />
<p><b>C.</b></p>
<p><b>Transparency Requirements to Protect and Promote Internet Openness</b></p>
<b>1.</b><br />
<p><b>The 2010 Transparency Rule</b></p>
63.<br />
In the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, the Commission concluded that effective disclosure of <br />
broadband providers’ network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of service <br />promotes competition, innovation, investment, end-user choice, and broadband adoption.148  To that end, <br />the Commission adopted the following transparency rule:<br />
A person engaged in the provision of broadband Internet access service shall publicly <br />disclose accurate information regarding the network management practices, performance, <br />and commercial terms of its broadband Internet access services sufficient for consumers <br />to make informed choices regarding the use of such services and for content, application, <br />service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings.149<br />
64.<br />
The Commission determined that the best approach to implementing the transparency <br />
rule was to allow broadband providers flexibility, while providing guidance concerning effective <br />disclosure.150 The Commission stated that “effective disclosures will likely include” information <br />concerning “some or all” of the following topics: (1) network practices, including congestion <br />management, application-specific behavior, device attachment rules, and security measures; <br />(2) performance characteristics, including a general description of system performance (such as speed and <br />latency) and the effects of specialized services on available capacity; and (3) commercial terms, including <br />pricing, privacy policies, and redress options.151 In 2011, the Commission’s Enforcement Bureau and <br />Office of General Counsel issued advisory guidance to further clarify compliance with the transparency <br />requirements regarding point-of-sale disclosures, service descriptions, security measures, and the extent <br />
                                                     <br />

In so doing, the Commission stated that broadband providers must, at a minimum, <br />prominently display or provide links to disclosures on a publicly available, easily accessible website that is available <br />to current and prospective end users and edge providers as well as the Commission, and must disclose relevant <br />information at the point of sale.  <i>Id.  </i>In addition, the Commission clarified that the transparency rule did not require <br />public disclosure of competitively sensitive information or information that would compromise network security or <br />undermine the efficacy of reasonable network management practices. <i>Id.<br /></i>151 <i>Id. </i>at 17938-39, para. 56 (noting that this list is not necessarily exhaustive). <br />

of required disclosures, while noting that “these particular methods of compliance are not required or <br />exclusive; broadband providers may comply with the transparency rule in other ways.”152  <br />
65.<br />
The D.C. Circuit’s decision in <i>Verizon v. FCC </i>upheld the transparency rule, which <br />
remains in full force, applicable to both fixed and mobile providers.153 In today’s Notice, we inquire as to <br />ways that the transparency rule can be improved, taking into account changes in the nature of the <br />provision of broadband services since 2010. We believe we have ample authority not only for our <br />existing transparency rule, but also for the enhanced transparency rule we propose today, whether the <br />Commission ultimately relies on section 706, Title II, or another source of legal authority.  We seek <br />comment on whether and how—if at all—the source of the Commission’s legal authority relied upon to <br />adopt other open Internet rules would affect the authority or authorities that provide the strongest basis for <br />any improvements to the transparency rule or otherwise would inform how we define the goal of <br />transparency in general.154    <br />

“Sunlight,” as Justice Brandeis has explained, “is . . . the best of disinfectants.”155  If <br />
designed correctly, disclosure policies are among the most effective and least intrusive regulatory <br />measures at the Commission’s disposal.156 Applied here, the Commission continues to believe that access <br />to accurate information about broadband provider practices encourages the competition, innovation, and <br />high-quality services that drive consumer demand and broadband investment and deployment.157 The <br />transparency rule thereby reflects the “virtuous circle” that, in the long term, unites the interests of end <br />

users, edge providers, and the broader Internet community.  As the Commission explained in the <i>Open <br />Internet Order</i>, disclosures under the rule:  (1) help end users make informed choices regarding the <br />purchase and use of broadband services and increase end users’ confidence in broadband providers’ <br />practices; (2) ensure that edge providers have access to broadband providers’ network information <br />necessary to develop innovative new applications and services; and (3) inform the Internet community <br />and the Commission about broadband providers’ practices and conduct that could impact Internet <br />openness.158 In today’s Notice, we seek comment on the effectiveness of the existing transparency rule <br />and on whether and, if so, how the rule should be enhanced to meet its goals with respect to end users, <br />edge providers, the Internet community, and the Commission.   <br />
67.<br />
Today, we seek general comment on how well the Commission’s existing transparency <br />
rule is working.  We are especially interested in comments that describe the current operation, benefits,<br />and shortcomings of the existing rule, how broadband providers are complying with it, and how we <br />should measure such compliance.159  We are also mindful that the additional rules we propose today to <br />protect Internet openness consistent with the D.C. Circuit’s decision may place even greater importance <br />on the extent to which information about broadband providers’ practices is disclosed to end users, edge <br />providers, and the Commission.  Taking all of that into account, we tentatively conclude that we should <br />enhance the transparency rule to improve its effectiveness for end users, edge providers, the Internet <br />community, and the Commission.  We seek comment on this tentative conclusion and on what burdens or <br />compliance issues may be associated with this approach, including for smaller providers.  <br />
68.<br />
<i>Tailored disclosures.  </i>In the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, the Commission stated that broadband <br />
providers may be able to satisfy the transparency rule through use of a single disclosure, and therefore did <br />not require different types of disclosures to different parties such as individual end users, edge providers, <br />the broader Internet community, and the Commission.160  We have concerns that a single disclosure may <br />not provide the required disclosures in a manner that adequately satisfies the informational needs of all <br />affected parties.  For example, some recent research suggests that consumers have difficulty <br />understanding commonly used terms associated with the provision of broadband services.161  Edge <br />providers, however, may benefit from descriptions that are more technically detailed.162  We therefore <br />tentatively conclude that it would be more effective to require broadband providers to more specifically <br />tailor disclosures to the needs of these affected parties.  We seek comment on this tentative conclusion, on <br />the nature of the disclosures that should be tailored, and on what burdens or compliance issues, if any, <br />may be associated with more targeted disclosures.  <br />

<p><b>Transparency to End Users</b></p>
69.<br />
Since the Commission adopted the transparency rule, we have received hundreds of <br />
complaints from consumers suggesting that, under the rule, broadband providers may not be providing<br />end user consumers the accurate information they need and have a right to receive.163  Of particular <br />
                                                     <br />
158 <i>Open Internet Order</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 17936-37, para. 53. <br />159 We note that an informal review of broadband provider disclosures conducted by Commission staff found that <br />the majority are providing some form of disclosure statements, but that many do not appear to provide all the <br />information the rule was designed to disclose.  <br />160 <i>Open Internet Order</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 17940, para. 58. <br />161 Cooper Thesis at 186-88 (citing a study which found that consumers do not understand basic terminology such as <br />“traffic management”); <i>see also </i>2013 OIAC Annual Report at 82-88 (noting studies that indicate consumers are <br />confused when choosing service providers).<br />162 <i>See, e.g.</i>, Cogent Comments at 17 (asserting that “the information provided to date by many broadband providers <br />has been of limited or no utility to end users or edge providers”).<br />163 Our analysis of consumer complaints received since the transparency rule took effect shows a significant number <br />of consumer complaints about provider speeds, charges, and other commercial practices that the rule was designed <br />

concern to many consumers is that the speed of their service falls short of the advertised speed.164 Many <br />consumers complain that they have been charged amounts greater than advertised rates, including fees <br />and charges beyond basic rates.165  We have also received a number of consumer complaints raising <br />questions about the source of slow or congested services.166  Consumers have also reported surprise at <br />broadband providers’ statements about slowed or terminated service based on consumers’ “excessive <br />use.”  Other consumers report confusion about how data consumption is calculated for purposes of data <br />caps.167  <br />
70.<br />
We seek comment on the extent to which the existing transparency rule is effectively <br />
informing end users.  We are interested both in what information broadband providers are disclosing to <br />end users and how that information is being disclosed.  In addition, we seek comment on the incentives <br />and ability of broadband providers to provide service at lower quality or higher prices than their <br />subscribers expected when they enrolled, and on the incentives and ability of subscribers to choose other <br />options if their broadband providers fail to live up to these expectations.  If a subscriber is locked in to a <br />particular provider, how can transparency rules bring the performance of that provider up to the <br />subscriber’s expectations?<br />
71.<br />
In light of the consumer complaints discussed above, we also consider enhancements to <br />
the existing rule with respect to the content, form, and method of broadband providers’ disclosures to end <br />users.  <br />
72.<br />
<i>Content and Form of Disclosure.  </i>We seek comment on whether there are ways to make <br />
the content and format of disclosures more accessible and understandable to end users.  With respect to <br />content, should the Commission require the disclosure of specific broadband provider network practices, <br />performance characteristics (e.g<i>.</i>, effective download speeds, upload speeds, latency, and packet loss),<br />and/or terms and conditions of service to end users (e.g<i>.</i>, data caps)?  We are particularly interested in <br />whether there are network practices, performance characteristics, or commercial terms relating to <br />broadband service that are particularly essential but not easily discoverable by end users absent effective <br />disclosure.  With respect to format, both academic research and the Commission’s experience with <br />consumer issues have demonstrated that the manner in which providers display information to consumers <br />can have as much impact on consumer decisions as the information itself.168  We therefore seek comment <br />
(Continued from previous page)                                                            <br />to disclose.  Excerpts from some of those complaints are included below.  In some cases, however, it is difficult to <br />discern whether the consumer’s frustration is with slow speeds or high prices generally, or instead with how the <br />service as actually provided differs from what the provider has advertised.<br />164 For example, one consumer stated that he “was promised 50Mbps of Internet speed.  At no time during [his] <br />service [had he] ever had this speed of service and the deceptive claim remains on [the provider’s] website and in <br />marketing materials.”<br />165 One consumer complained that actual bill is “almost 20%” higher than advertised price due to fees.<br />166 For example, one consumer stated that “I was sold Internet access, but I believe bandwidth through to Netflix is <br />being artificially restricted.  I have checked access to other providers and it is greater than 10X that of Netflix.  <br />I have contacted Netflix to verify their function.  Their equipment is functioning properly.”  <br />167 One consumer complained that the vendor stated the file size as 2.1 megabytes (MB), but the provider counted <br />download as 144 MB.<br />168 <i>See generally </i>James M. Lacko &amp; Janis K. Pappalardo, <i>Improving Consumer Mortgage Disclosures: An <br />Empirical Assessment of Current and Prototype Disclosure Forms</i>, FTC Bureau of Economics Report (June 2007), <br /><a title="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2007/06/P025505MortgageDisclosureReport.pdf" href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2007/06/P025505MortgageDisclosureReport.pdf">http://www.ftc.gov/os/2007/06/P025505MortgageDisclosureReport.pdf</a> (stating that quantitative consumer testing <br />shows that the form of mortgage cost disclosure affects consumer understanding of mortgage costs); Sumit Agarwal, <br />John C.

on best practices for displaying and formatting relevant disclosures for end users, including any potential <br />costs and burdens to broadband providers.169  For example, the Open Internet Advisory Committee <br />(OIAC) has proposed the use of a standardized label for Internet service that includes basic information <br />such as performance speed (i.e., upload and download speed), price (i.e., monthly fee averaged over three <br />years), and usage restrictions (i.e., any points at which the applicable terms of service change, including <br />data usage caps and any charges, speed reductions, or other penalties for exceeding a cap) that consumers <br />can use to comparison shop for service.170  Are there lessons we can learn regarding effective disclosure <br />practices from independent consumer research or disclosure in other approaches to standardized labels?171  <br />Should the information be made available in a machine-readable format, such as XML, that might allow <br />the Commission, industry associations, or other organizations to easily access and synthesize information <br />for consumers?<br />
73.<br />
<i>Network Practices.  </i>With respect to data caps, should we require disclosures that permit <br />
end users to identify application-specific usage or to distinguish which user or device contributed to <br />which part of the total data usage?  Should we require disclosure of any type of traffic exempted from any <br />data caps, and how end users can find their current consumption levels?  Should we require that <br />disclosures explain any restrictions on tethering for mobile devices?  Should the Commission expand its <br />transparency efforts to include measurement of other aspects of service such as packet loss, packet <br />corruption, latency, and jitter in addition to upstream and downstream speed?  Should the Commission <br />require the reporting of actual achieved results for each category?  If providers offer different tiers of <br />service to their end users, should providers be required to make disclosures by tier?  What should be the <br />required timing of any such disclosures?  Is it important that network practices be disclosed in advance of <br />their implementation?<br />
74.<br />
<i>Method of Disclosure.  </i>The <i>Transparency Compliance PN </i>advised broadband providers <br />
that they can comply with the point-of-sale disclosure requirement by, for instance, “directing prospective <br />customers at the point of sale, orally and/or prominently in writing, to a web address at which the required <br />disclosures are clearly posted and updated.”172  We seek comment on whether that approach is adequate <br />or whether the Commission should consider alternative approaches.    <br />
(Continued from previous page)                                                            <br /><i>Choosing the Wrong Calling Plan? Ignorance and Learning</i>, 93 Am. Econ. Rev. 297 (2003) (stating that consumers <br />select rationally among telephone calling plans).<br />169 In 2011, the United Kingdom’s largest Internet service providers agreed to a voluntary Code of Practice which <br />requires each one to produce a comparable table of traffic management information called a Key Facts Indicator <br />(KFI).  <i>See, e.g.</i>, Ofcom, Improving Traffic Management Transparency, <br /><a title="http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/2011/11/improving-traffic-management-transparency/" href="http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/2011/11/improving-traffic-management-transparency/">http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/2011/11/improving-traffic-management-transparency/</a> (last visited May 12, 2014).<br />170 <i>See </i>2013 OIAC Annual Report at 82-88 (containing information about the OIAC Label Study); <i>see also </i>New <br />America Foundation, Broadband Truth-in-Labeling, Open Technology Initiative (2009), <br /><a title="http://newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/NAF_OTI_Broadband_Truth_in_Labeling-09" href="http://newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/NAF_OTI_Broadband_Truth_in_Labeling-09">http://newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/NAF_OTI_Broadband_Truth_in_Labeling-09</a>-<br />2009.pdf.<br />171 For example, the Federal Trade Commission’s Energy Guide labeling program requires standard labels on certain <br />appliances that disclose estimated yearly operating cost and energy use.  <i>See </i>16 C.F.R. Part 305.  The Federal Food, <br />Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act are the federal laws governing food <br />products under the Food and Drug Administration’s jurisdiction.  <i>See </i>21 U.S.C. §§ 301-399; 15 U.S.C. §§ 1451-<br />1461.  The FD&amp;C Act was amended by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, which requires most <br />foods to bear nutrition labeling and requires food labels that bear nutrient content claims and certain health messages <br />to comply with specific requirements.  <i>See </i>21 U.S.C. § 343-1.<br />172 <i>See Transparency Compliance PN</i>, 26 FCC Rcd at 9413-14 (clarifying that the rule does not compel the <br />distribution of disclosure materials in hard copy or extensive training of sales employees to provide disclosures <br />themselves).<br />

<p><b>Transparency to Edge Providers</b></p>
75.<br />
As noted above, the Commission also adopted the transparency rule to ensure that <br />
broadband providers would disclose sufficient information to permit “content, application, service, and <br />device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings.”173  Some commenters have <br />suggested that current disclosures provide insufficient information for edge providers.174  We seek <br />comment on how the existing transparency rule is working and how we can enhance its effectiveness with <br />respect to edge providers.  Should we view some categories of edge providers, such as start-up <br />companies, as having distinct needs and, if so, what would be the implications for an enhanced <br />transparency rule?  <br />
76.<br />
We also seek comment on the extent to which the transparency rule does, or should, <br />
disclose useful information to providers who seek to exchange traffic with broadband provider networks.  <br />In other words, should we view transit, CDN, or other providers engaged in Internet traffic exchange as a <br />class of persons whose interests are similar to those of edge providers who wish “to develop, market, and <br />maintain Internet offerings,” perhaps because they may have such edge providers as their customers?  For <br />instance, many edge providers utilize the services of an intermediary CDN, such as Akamai, EdgeCast, <br />Limelight, or Level 3, or cloud service providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, or RackSpace, which <br />provide the servers upon which the applications run and also interconnect directly with broadband <br />providers.  Other edge providers bypass these networks and interconnect directly with broadband <br />providers through peering arrangements.  Some edge providers, such as Google or Amazon, may act both <br />as content providers for their own services and as CDNs or cloud service providers for other services.  We <br />seek comment on whether these subgroups have distinguishable needs for information that could be <br />provided through disclosure and, if so, what kind of information would be most useful.  <br />

<p><b>Transparency to the Internet Community and the Commission</b></p>
77.<br />
<i>The Common Interests of End Users</i>, <i>Edge Providers, and the Broader Internet </i><br />
<i>Community. </i>We seek comment on the extent to which the existing transparency rule fully reflects the <br />“virtuous circle” that, in the long term, unites the interests of end users, edge providers, the broader <br />Internet community, and the Commission.  Are there ways to enhance the transparency rule to further <br />facilitate the virtuous circle?  What other disclosures might encourage and improve the deployment of <br />broadband in the United States?<br />
78.<br />
We also seek comment—relevant to all stakeholders—on whether and, if so, how the <br />
Commission should enhance the existing transparency rule to ensure the effectiveness of, and compliance <br />with, the other rules we propose in today’s Notice.  For example, to ensure the effectiveness of the no-<br />blocking rule proposed below, should the Commission mandate that broadband providers disclose—in a <br />more rigorous and consistent way—the expected performance end users can expect from their broadband <br />service?175  To improve information about broadband provider practices for end users, edge providers, <br />and the broader Internet community, we tentatively conclude that broadband providers must disclose in a <br />timely manner to consumers, edge providers, and the public (and, of course, the Commission) when they <br />make changes to their network practices as well as any instances of blocking, throttling, and pay-for-<br />priority arrangements, or the parameters of default or “best effort” service as distinct from any priority <br />service.<br />
79.<br />
<i>Measuring Broadband Performance.  </i>The <i>Open Internet Order </i>requires broadband <br />
providers to disclose accurate information regarding network performance for each broadband service <br />they provide.176  The accuracy and availability of such network performance information is a common <br />                                                     <br />

linchpin for end users, edge providers, and all stakeholders in the Internet community.  As noted in the <br /><i>Order</i>, the Commission launched a broadband performance measurement project called “Measuring <br />Broadband America” (MBA) to accurately measure key performance metrics, including baseline <br />connection speed and latency.177  To satisfy their obligations under the transparency rule, all of the <br />12 largest fixed broadband providers chose to participate in the measurement program.178  Last year the <br />Commission expanded its MBA program to include mobile broadband by releasing a Mobile Broadband <br />Speed Test App, an open-source, crowdsourcing program to assess mobile broadband network <br />performance nationwide.179  The app measures mobile broadband and Wi-Fi network performance and <br />delivers to consumers an in-depth view of key metrics related to their mobile broadband experience.  We <br />seek comment on the effectiveness of this approach for providing consumers with useful information <br />regarding the performance of both fixed and mobile broadband networks.  We seek comment on whether <br />participation in MBA should continue to satisfy the requirement that actual speeds be disclosed.180  Are <br />there areas of this program that can be improved to provide more useful information to consumers?181  <br />
80.<br />
More generally, are there more efficient or more comprehensive ways to measure <br />
network performance metrics, including for broadband providers not participating in MBA?  For <br />example, could the ability to measure and report network performance be included in the end user’s own <br />network modem or residential gateway?  Do such functionalities currently exist, or are they in <br />development?182  Are there academic or other external research organizations that could assist the <br />Commission in collecting and analyzing information about traffic, congestion, and other features of the <br />Internet?183  Should the Commission mandate the use of monitoring devices, like those used in MBA?  <br />How can performance metrics most accurately measure the actual download and upload speeds a <br />consumer can expect to experience, rather than “up to” speeds or “last-mile” performance?  Should the <br />Commission look to an external advisory group to aid in the development and feasibility of performance <br />metrics and measurement?<br />
81.<br />
<i>Congestion</i>.  The <i>Open Internet Order </i>highlighted the value of providing end users with <br />
information about the sources of congestion that might impair the performance of edge-provider <br />services.184  As the <i>Open Internet Order </i>explained, “it is often difficult for end users to determine the <br />causes of slow or poor performance of content, applications, services or devices.”185 At the same time, <br />the Commission recognized that “congestion management may be a legitimate network management <br />

purpose.”186  But the Commission also emphasized the importance of the disclosure to end users of <br />“descriptions of congestion management practices” including “indicators of congestion” and “the typical <br />frequency of congestion.”187  <br />
82.<br />
Since the 2010 <i>Open Internet Order</i>, some have suggested that sources of congestion that <br />
impact end users may originate beyond the broadband provider’s network or in the exchange of traffic <br />between that network and others.  An end user’s inability to ascertain the source of congestion could lead <br />to confusion, for example, to the filing of an unjustified complaint against a broadband provider (if the <br />source of the congestion were elsewhere) or a mistaken decision by the end user to purchase additional <br />bandwidth to improve performance (again, if the source of congestion were elsewhere).  Edge providers <br />and other stakeholders also have expressed a need for greater information about network congestion.188  <br />
83.<br />
In light of these concerns, we tentatively conclude that we should require that broadband <br />
providers disclose meaningful information regarding the source, location, timing, speed, packet loss, and <br />duration of network congestion.  We seek comment on this tentative conclusion, including on how to <br />implement it in a practical manner that provides meaningful information to end users, edge providers, and <br />other stakeholders without causing undue burden on broadband providers.  For example, should the <br />information to be disclosed be based upon a sampling taken at given points in time, and if so, what would <br />be an appropriate interval for such sampling?  We note that Cogent has made suggestions about <br />enhancements to the transparency rule along these lines and proposing specific means of implementation, <br />upon which we seek comment.189  In making the foregoing tentative conclusion and seeking comment on <br />how to implement it, we emphasize that we are positing that the public would be served by additional <br />information concerning the existence and duration of congestion, regardless of its cause, so that there is <br />greater understanding of the impact of that congestion on the performance of a broadband provider’s <br />network, if any.  We do not, however, propose to expand the scope of the open Internet rules in any <br />fashion to regulate traffic exchange, though, as noted above, we ask for public input on this tentative <br />conclusion.190<br />
<b>d.</b><br />
<p><b>Transparency for Mobile Broadband</b></p>
84.<br />
The Commission currently applies the same transparency requirement to both fixed and <br />
mobile providers, reasoning that end users need a clear understanding of “network management practices, <br />performance, and commercial terms, regardless of the broadband platform they use to access the <br />Internet.”191  We seek comment on how we should assess the effectiveness of the existing rule in the <br />mobile broadband context.  For example, most mobile broadband plan offerings have generally had lower <br />data usage limits than those offered for fixed broadband services.  Accordingly, do mobile broadband <br />

subscribers have an enhanced need to understand, monitor, and more flexibly adjust their mobile data <br />usage needs than the fixed broadband users?    <br />
85.<br />
We seek comment on whether and, if so, how enhancements to the transparency rule <br />
should apply to mobile broadband network providers.  Would the enhanced transparency requirements <br />described herein, or others, help meet the information needs of mobile broadband device and application <br />developers as well as the needs of end users?  How can we make sure that the disclosure requirements <br />discussed above are appropriate and effective for mobile broadband in view of the many operational <br />factors that may influence performance of mobile broadband networks, including the mobile access <br />technology, the weather, the distance to the serving cell site, the number of users in a cell site, and device <br />capability?192  Should the nature of disclosure to customers of wireless networks be different if the <br />wireless service is provided by a network as an explicit substitute for copper-based, traditional service, <br />including voice and DSL?<br />
<b>e.</b><br />
<p><b>Burdens of Enhanced Transparency on Broadband Providers</b></p>
86.<br />
We seek comment on the extent to which adopting enhanced transparency requirements <br />
would create particular burdens in either the fixed or the mobile broadband environment and whether and <br />how such burdens would affect the pace of innovation, investment, and growth. How can we achieve the <br />public benefits of enhanced disclosure requirements without imposing unreasonable burdens on the <br />broadband providers?  Are there ways to minimize the costs and burdens associated with any enhanced <br />disclosure requirements?  Are there ways the Commission or industry associations could reduce any such <br />burdens, for example through the use of a voluntary industry standardized glossary, or through the <br />creation of a dashboard that permits easy comparison of the policies, procedures, and prices of various <br />broadband providers throughout the country? <br />
<b>3.</b><br />
<p><b>Compliance and Enforcement</b></p>
87.<br />
In the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, the Commission noted that a key objective of the <br />
transparency rule is to enable the Commission to collect information necessary to assess, report, and <br />enforce the open Internet rules.193<i>  </i>As discussed further below, we seek comment on how the Commission <br />can best design a process for enforcing the transparency rule that provides certainty, flexibility, and <br />access for all affected parties.194  Should the Commission permit individuals to report possible <br />noncompliance with our open Internet rules anonymously or take other steps to protect the identity of <br />individuals who may be concerned about retaliation for raising concerns?  We propose that the <br />consequences of a failure to comply with our transparency rule should be significant and include <br />monetary penalties.  We seek comment on the most effective methods to ensure ongoing compliance with <br />the transparency rule.  How can we ensure that these disclosure requirements are as effective and <br />effectively enforced as disclosure requirements in other areas of the law, such as disclosures to the <br />Securities and Exchange Commission?

<p><b>D.</b></p>
<p><b>Preventing Blocking of Lawful Content, Applications, Services, and Nonharmful <br />Devices</b></p>
89.<br />
We believe that, as the Commission found in the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, “the freedom to <br />
send and receive lawful content and to use and provide applications and services without fear of blocking <br />is essential to the Internet’s openness and to competition in adjacent markets such as voice <br />communications and video and audio programming.”199  The D.C. Circuit acknowledged the validity of <br />this policy rationale for the no-blocking rule adopted in the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, but vacated the rule <br />because it found that the Commission had failed to provide a legal rationale under which the prohibition <br />would not impermissibly subject broadband providers to common carriage regulation.200  To address the <br />ongoing concerns with the harmful effects that blocking of Internet traffic would have on Internet <br />openness, we propose to adopt the text of the no-blocking rule that the Commission adopted in 2010, with <br />a clarification that it does not preclude broadband providers from negotiating individualized, <br />differentiated arrangements with similarly situated edge providers (subject to the separate commercial<br />reasonableness rule or its equivalent).  So long as broadband providers do not degrade lawful content or <br />service to below a minimum level of access, they would not run afoul of the proposed rule.  We also seek <br />comment below on how to define that minimum level of service.  Alternatively, we seek comment on <br />whether we should adopt a no-blocking rule that does not allow for priority agreements with edge <br />providers and how we would do so consistent with sources of legal authority other than section 706, <br />including Title II.201  <br />
90.<br />
It is important to understand the relationship between the proposed no-blocking and <br />
commercial reasonableness rules. Although the proposed no-blocking rule only establishes a minimum <br />level of service, and thus allows room for individualized negotiations, the proposed commercial <br />reasonableness rule separately applies to any and all conduct, including by asking whether paid <br />prioritization can be barred outright and by asking whether to bar practices that harm competition, <br />consumers, and the free exercise of speech.  <br />

<p><b>The 2010 No-Blocking Rule</b></p>
91.<br />
<i>2010 Open Internet Order.  </i>In the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, the Commission adopted a no-<br />
blocking rule to preserve the openness that was and remains a core expectation of end users.202  The <i>Open <br />Internet Order </i>noted that a no-blocking principle had been broadly accepted since its inclusion in the <br />Commission’s 2005 <i>Internet Policy Statement</i>,203 and the <i>Internet Policy Statement </i>itself reflected <br />expectations and practices of how the Internet should and did work.204  A more limited variation of the <br />rule applied to mobile broadband providers, due to the operational constraints that affect mobile <br />broadband services, the rapidly evolving nature of the mobile broadband technologies, and the generally <br />greater amount of consumer choice for mobile broadband services than for fixed.205   <br />
92.<br />
<i>D.C. Circuit Opinion in Verizon v. FCC.  </i>The D.C. Circuit struck down the no-blocking <br />
rule after finding that the Commission had failed to provide a legal justification that would take the rule <br />out of the realm of impermissible common carriage.206  The court stated that it was “somewhat less clear” <br />whether the no-blocking rule constituted <i>per se </i>common carriage regulation than whether the <br />antidiscrimination rule did.207  Nonetheless, the court concluded that the no-blocking rule, at least as <br />described in the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, required broadband providers to serve edge providers <br />indiscriminately.208  The no-blocking rule thereby imposed <i>per se </i>common carriage rules and thus <br />violated the Communications Act’s prohibition on the imposition of common carrier obligations on <br />providers of information services.209     <br />
93.<br />
The court intimated that the no-blocking rule could pass scrutiny, however, if broadband <br />
providers could engage in individualized bargaining while subject to the rule.  The court reasoned that “if <br />the relevant service that broadband providers furnish is access to their subscribers generally, as opposed <br />to access to their subscribers at the specific minimum speed necessary to satisfy the anti-blocking rules, <br />then these rules, while perhaps establishing a lower limit on the forms that broadband providers’ <br />arrangements with edge providers could take, might nonetheless leave sufficient ‘room for individualized <br />bargaining and discrimination in terms’ so as not to run afoul of the statutory prohibitions of common <br />carrier treatment.”210  Such a practice would allow for individualized bargaining where providers would <br />not be required “to hold themselves out to serve all comers indiscriminately on the same or standardized <br />terms.”211  If the Commission’s no-blocking rule allowed individualized bargaining above the minimum <br />level of service necessary, then the rule might not create <i>per se </i>common carriage obligations.212  The <br />court noted that although the Commission had asserted this interpretation of the rule at oral argument, the <br />

court could not consider it as a possible basis for upholding the rule because the Commission had not <br />advanced this position in the <i>Open Internet Order</i>.213<br />
<b>2.</b><br />
<p><b>Proposal to Adopt a No-Blocking Rule </b></p>
94.<br />
We continue to believe that safeguarding consumers’ ability to access and effectively use <br />
the lawful content, applications, services, and devices of their choice on the Internet is an essential <br />component of protecting and promoting the open Internet.  Therefore, we tentatively conclude that we <br />should adopt the text of the rule that the Commission adopted in the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, which <br />provided:  <br />
A person engaged in the provision of fixed broadband Internet access service, insofar as <br />such person is so engaged, shall not block lawful content, applications, services, or non-<br />harmful devices, subject to reasonable network management.214<br />
A person engaged in the provision of mobile broadband Internet access service, insofar as <br />such person is so engaged, shall not block consumers from accessing lawful websites, <br />subject to reasonable network management; nor shall such person block applications that <br />compete with the provider’s voice or video telephony services, subject to reasonable <br />network management.215<br />
95.<br />
We believe this to be the public policy that will best serve Internet openness.  While <br />
maintaining this rule text, we propose to make clear that the no-blocking rule would allow individualized <br />bargaining above a minimum level of access to a broadband provider’s subscribers—the revised rationale <br />the court suggested would be permissible rather than <i>per se </i>common carriage—but, also consistent with <br />the court’s analysis, separately subject such practices to scrutiny under the commercially reasonable <br />practices rule (or its equivalent).  We believe that by preserving end users’ ability to access the Internet <br />content of their choice, reinstating a no-blocking rule would increase demand for broadband services and <br />thus increase investment in broadband network infrastructure and technologies.216  We seek comment on <br />the proposed no-blocking rule and its potential effect on broadband investment and deployment, including <br />whether and under what circumstances broadband providers have incentives to block content.  We also <br />seek comment on possible approaches other than adopting the text of the 2010 rule.  Should we modify <br />the text of the rule to explicitly address the minimum level of access required, as discussed below?  <br />
96.<br />
Alternatively, we seek comment on whether we should adopt a no-blocking rule that <br />
either itself prohibits broadband providers from entering into priority agreements with edge providers or <br />acts in combination with a separate rule prohibiting such conduct.217  As discussed below, the record in <br />this proceeding reflects numerous public concerns about the potential for priority agreements to harm an <br />open Internet.218  How could we address such concerns in the context of the no-blocking rule?

Commission were to proceed down this alternative path, how should the Commission define “priority”?  <br />Are “priority” agreements broader than “pay-for-priority,” possibly including the exchange of <br />consideration other than money?  Are there other arrangements between broadband providers and edge <br />providers that have the potential to harm Internet openness and should be addressed within the no-<br />blocking rule?  Commenters should address the legal bases and theories, including Title II, that the <br />Commission could rely on for such a no-blocking rule, and how different sources of authority might lead <br />to different formulations of the no-blocking rule.  <br />
<b>3.</b><br />
<p><b>Establishing the Minimum Level of Access under the No-Blocking Rule</b></p>
97.<br />
As noted above, the D.C. Circuit suggested that the Commission’s 2010 no-blocking rule <br />
could be interpreted as requiring broadband providers to “furnish . . . access to their subscribers <br />generally” while “establishing a lower limit on the forms that broadband providers’ arrangements with <br />edge providers could take”—and that under that interpretation the rule might not impose common carrier <br />status on broadband providers.219  Consistent with the court’s ruling, we tentatively conclude that the <br />revived no-blocking rule should be interpreted as requiring broadband providers to furnish edge providers <br />with a minimum level of access to their end-user subscribers.220 We tentatively conclude that our <br />proposed no-blocking rule would allow broadband providers sufficient flexibility to negotiate terms of <br />service individually with edge providers, consistent with the court’s view that we must permit providers <br />to “adapt . . . to individualized circumstances without having to hold themselves out to serve all comers <br />indiscriminately on the same or standardized terms.”221 We reiterate that, as discussed further below, <br />under the proposed rules contained herein such individualized arrangements for priority treatment would <br />be subject to scrutiny under the proposed commercial reasonableness rule and prohibited under that rule if <br />they harm Internet openness.  We seek comment on these tentative conclusions.<br />
98.<br />
Requiring this minimum level of access under the no-blocking rule will ensure that all <br />
users have access to an Internet experience that is sufficiently robust, fast, and effectively usable.222 This <br />includes both end-user consumers and edge providers of all types and sizes, including those content <br />providers who do not enter into specific arrangements with broadband providers.  In short, our approach<br />will enable consumers to access the content, services, and applications they demand and ensure that <br />innovators and edge providers have the ability to offer new products and services.  We seek comment on <br />this analysis.  <br />
99.<br />
Under the approach described by the D.C. Circuit, “broadband providers [would] have no <br />
obligation to actually provide an edge provider with the minimum service necessary to satisfy the rules,” <br />because they could instead “deliver all edge providers’ traffic” in a manner that exceeds that minimum, <br />and they would then be free to “negotiate separate agreements with each individual edge provider” and <br />also to “charge similarly-situated edge providers completely different prices for the same service.”223  Are <br />there alternative approaches that, consistent with the <i>Verizon </i>decision, would avoid <i>per se </i>common <br />
                                                     <br />
219 <i>Verizon</i>, 740 F.3d at 658. <br />220 Such actions, permissible under the no-blocking rule, would, of course, be separately subject to the proposed <br />commercially reasonable practices standard set out below.  <i>See infra </i>Section III.E.<br />221 <i>Verizon</i>, 740 F.3d at 652 (quoting <i>Cellco P’ship v. FCC</i>, 700 F.3d 534, 548 (D.C. Cir. 2012)).  In this regard, we <br />view the operation of the no-blocking rule separate from any other impact on broadband providers that might arise <br />from application of the legal standard, factors, and dispute resolution framework discussed below.  <i>See infra <br /></i>Sections III.E, III.F, III.H.<br />222 <i>See infra </i>Appx. A (proposing a definition of “block” for purposes of the no-blocking rule).<br />223 <i>Verizon</i>, 740 F.3d at 658.  We note that a broadband provider’s discretion in setting rates could be constrained to <br />some degree by the commercially reasonable standard and dispute resolution framework discussed below, if adopted <br />by the Commission.  <i>See infra </i>Sections III.E, III.H.  As we explain below, that proposed standard would not <br />constitute <i>per se </i>common carriage.<br />

<p><b>FCC 14-61</b></p>
carriage?  Are there forms of price discrimination that, even if appropriate under the no-blocking rule, <br />should be separately subject to the commercial reasonableness rule or its equivalent?   <br />
100.<br />
We also seek comment on how, consistent with this interpretation, we should define or <br />
clarify the minimum level of access required by the rule, or otherwise define what provider conduct <br />would constitute “blocking” under the rule.  In our view, a defined minimum level of access provides <br />assurances both to end users, by helping them understand the potential uses of their service, and to edge <br />providers.  Such assurances should enhance consumer demand, which drives investment both in the <br />network and at the edge.  <br />
101.<br />
We also seek comment on how “minimum level of access” should be defined to provide <br />
the robust, fast, and effectively usable access discussed above.  Should we define the minimum level of <br />access from the perspective of end users, edge providers, or both?  Should the minimum level of access be <br />dynamic, evolving over time, and if so, how can that flexibility be incorporated into the rule?  In the <br />following paragraphs, we describe in alphabetical order several possible options by which we may define <br />a minimum level of access under the no-blocking rule.  We seek comment on these options and on any <br />approaches by which the Commission should define the minimum level of access.  For each of these <br />potential options, we seek comment on its advantages and disadvantages, on its legal sustainability under <br /><i>Verizon</i>, and on how effective it would be at protecting the open Internet, including the ease or difficulty <br />with which violations can be identified and remedied.  We seek comment on how the Commission should <br />implement, monitor compliance with, and enforce the rule, under each of the options described.  For each <br />option, we also seek comment on whether the minimum level of access should be reflected in providers’ <br />disclosures under an enhanced transparency rule.  Under any of these options, we seek comment on how <br />the minimum level of access should be measured.  Should the Commission measure technical parameters, <br />based on a sample, focusing on speed, packet loss, latency, or other factors?  Where in the network should <br />such measurement take place to ensure an accurate measure of the broadband provider’s performance?  <br />Finally, we recognize that from time to time a provider may be unable to provide such a minimum level <br />of access temporarily for a variety of reasons.224  We seek comment on how the Commission should <br />distinguish such temporary inadvertent failures from intentional or prolonged blocking, including whether <br />the Commission should consider exempting incidents of blocking that last for less than a specified <br />amount of time.    <br />
102.<br />
<i>Best Effort.</i>  One way to define a minimum level of access is as a requirement that <br />
broadband providers apply no less than a “best effort” standard to deliver traffic to end users.225  For any <br />particular type of Internet traffic, best-effort delivery would represent the “typical” level of service for <br />that type of traffic—in effect, routing traffic according to the “traditional” architecture of the Internet.226  <br />Broadband providers would be free to negotiate “better than typical” delivery with edge providers, and <br />would be prohibited (subject to reasonable network management) from delivering “worse than typical” <br />service in the form of degradation or outright blocking.  We seek comment on this potential approach.  <br />
                                                     <br />
224 Aside from complete outages (which are not the subject of this Notice), we note that in some cases inadvertent <br />action or circumstances outside a provider’s control may cause a subset of traffic to be blocked.  For example, if a <br />connection with one of several peering partners is severed, some Internet traffic may seem unacceptably slow while <br />other traffic appears normal.  Alternatively, a provider engaged in reasonable network management (such as <br />blocking the source of a distributed denial of service attack) may inadvertently block other traffic due to a <br />transcription error.  If steps are taken in a timely manner to correct such problems, we would not anticipate <br />considering such action to violate a no-blocking rule.     <br />225 <i>See, e.g</i>., S. Floyd &amp; M. Allman, <i>Comments on the Usefulness of Simple Best-Effort Traffic </i>9-14, Internet <br />Engineering Task Force (July 2008), <a title="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5290" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5290">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5290</a>.<br />226 <i>Open Internet NPRM</i>, 24 FCC Rcd at 13086, para. 56 (“The Internet has traditionally relied on an end-to-end, <br />open architecture, in which network operators use their ‘best effort’ to deliver packets to their intended destinations <br />without quality-of-service guarantees.”).<br />
37<br />
<hr>
<A name=38></a><p><b>Federal Communications Commission</b></p>
<p><b>FCC 14-61</b></p>
Would “best effort” be measured against the technical capacity of a particular broadband provider’s <br />network capacity and characteristics?<br />
103.<br />
<i>Minimum Quantitative Performance.</i>  Another way to define a minimum level of access <br />
is through specific technical parameters, such as a minimum speed.  To the extent that commenters <br />believe that the Commission should promulgate a rule that establishes specific technical parameters for <br />the required minimum level of access, what should those parameters be?  Should they identify specific <br />speeds of service, or would it be preferable to identify specific problems that a minimum level of service <br />would avoid (such as preventing latency and jitter for services that tolerate them poorly)?227  Would the <br />Commission need to differentiate between different broadband access technologies?  While this approach <br />would provide greater certainty than other approaches, a specific technical definition of minimum access <br />could become outdated as available broadband network technologies change and available broadband <br />speeds improve.  How frequently would we need to revisit a specific technical definition of minimum <br />access to ensure that it keeps up with advances in broadband service?<br />
104.<br />
<i>An Objective</i>, <i>Evolving “Reasonable Person” Standard.</i>  Another approach to defining a <br />
minimum level of access to broadband providers’ end users is to think of it as the level that satisfies the <br />reasonable expectations of a typical end user.  We might think of this as a “reasonable person” standard of <br />access.  For example, a typical end user may reasonably expect the ability to access streaming video from <br />any provider, place and receive telephone calls using the VoIP service of the end user’s choosing, and <br />access any lawful web content.  Under this approach, a broadband provider that satisfies these and other <br />reasonable expectations would be in compliance with the no-blocking rule.  One possible advantage of <br />this approach to defining minimum access is flexibility:  the absence of a specific technical definition <br />means that the standard for compliance can evolve as the expectations in the marketplace change without <br />further Commission action.  On the other hand, this approach may create less certainty than other <br />approaches might and could be more difficult to enforce.  We seek comment generally on a “reasonable <br />person” standard for defining minimum access, and in particular, how this standard could be crafted to be <br />sufficiently objective and predictable to provide certainty to broadband providers and edge providers.  <br />
<b>4.</b><br />
<p><b>Application of the No-Blocking Rule to Mobile Broadband  </b></p>
105.<br />
As noted above, the 2010 no-blocking rule applied differently to mobile broadband <br />
providers than to fixed, and today’s Notice would maintain that approach.  The previous rule prohibited <br />mobile broadband providers from blocking consumers from accessing lawful websites or blocking <br />applications that compete with the provider’s voice or video telephony services.  We propose to adopt the <br />same approach as in the 2010 obligation, which would prohibit mobile broadband providers from <br />blocking lawful web content as well as applications that compete with the mobile broadband providers’ <br />own voice or video telephony services, subject to reasonable network management.  We seek comment on <br />this proposal.  <br />
106.<br />
In addition, we seek comment on whether it would serve the public interest to expand the <br />
rule’s scope to include reasonable access to all applications that compete with the mobile broadband <br />Internet access provider’s other services, not just those that compete with voice or video telephony <br />services, subject to reasonable network management practices.  Should the application of the no-blocking <br />rule to mobile broadband providers turn on whether mobile service was marketed to consumers as a <br />substitute for a fixed telecommunications service previously offered by the provider or its affiliate?  How <br />would treating mobile broadband differently from fixed broadband affect consumers in different <br />demographic groups, including those who rely solely on mobile broadband for Internet access?228  How <br />

107.<br />
We also seek comment on whether and how we should define a minimum level of access <br />
in the context of the proposed no-blocking rule for mobile broadband, or otherwise clarify what <br />constitutes “blocking,” and whether that definition should be different for mobile broadband than for <br />fixed.  For each of the approaches discussed above to define a “minimum level of access,” we seek <br />comment on any particular benefits or difficulties that such approach would present.  <br />
108.<br />
We recognize that there have been substantial mobile marketplace changes and <br />
developments since 2010, including the increased use of Wi-Fi technology, and seek comment on whether <br />and how such changes should impact our no-blocking rule for mobile broadband.  We seek comment on <br />the extent to which we should take into account the increasing provision of Wi-Fi by broadband <br />providers,229 and the growing use of Wi-Fi by end users for the off-load of wireless broadband, as we <br />consider the application of the no-blocking rule to mobile broadband services.230    <br />

<p><b>Applicability of the No-Blocking Rule to Devices</b></p>
109.<br />
The 2010 no-blocking rule prohibited fixed broadband providers from blocking non-<br />
harmful end-user devices, and the rule we propose today would do the same.  We seek comment on how <br />this treatment of non-harmful devices fits into the <i>Verizon </i>court’s interpretation of the rule.  Should the <br />ability to attach non-harmful devices to broadband service be included among the reasonable end-user <br />expectations listed above, or should we analyze non-harmful devices differently?    <br />

<p><b>Codifying an Enforceable Rule to Protect the Open Internet That Is Not Common <br />Carriage <i>Per Se</i></b></p>
110.<br />
Separate and distinct from the no-blocking rule, we believe that establishing an <br />
enforceable legal standard for broadband provider practices is necessary to preserve Internet openness, <br />protect consumers, and promote competition.  While the D.C. Circuit vacated the Commission’s rule <br />prohibiting “unreasonable discrimination” by fixed broadband providers on the theory that it “so limited <br />broadband providers’ control over edge providers’ transmissions that [it] constitute[d] common carriage <br /><i>per se</i>,” the court underscored the validity of the “commercially reasonable” legal standard the <br />Commission used in the data roaming context and the court upheld in <i>Cellco</i>.231  <br />

practices, while prohibiting those broadband provider practices that threaten to harm Internet openness.  <br />Our proposed approach contains three essential elements: (1) an enforceable legal standard of conduct <br />barring broadband provider practices that threaten to undermine Internet openness, providing certainty to <br />network providers, end users, and edge providers alike, (2) clearly established factors that give additional <br />guidance on the kind of conduct that is likely to violate the enforceable legal standard, and <br />(3) encouragement of individualized negotiation and, if necessary, a mechanism to allow the Commission <br />to evaluate challenged practices on a case-by-case basis, thereby providing flexibility in assessing <br />whether a particular practice comports with the legal standard.  We seek comment below on the design <br />and justification of this rule.  <br />
112.<br />
Alternatively, we also seek comment on whether the Commission should adopt an <br />
alternative legal standard to govern broadband providers’ practices.  How can we ensure that our <br />proposed rule sufficiently protects against harms to the open Internet?  How would the rule we propose <br />today change if the Commission were to rely on Title II (or other sources of legal authority) to adopt rules <br />to protect and promote Internet openness?232  We seek comment on how the goal of the proposed rule—to <br />prevent those broadband provider practices that limit Internet openness—could best be achieved.  <br />
<b>1.</b><br />
<p><b>The 2010 No Unreasonable Discrimination Rule</b></p>
113.<br />
<i>2010 Open Internet Order</i>.  The Commission adopted a no unreasonable discrimination <br />
rule to prevent fixed broadband providers from engaging in harmful conduct when transmitting lawful <br />network traffic over a consumer’s broadband Internet access service.233  The antidiscrimination rule <br />prohibited fixed broadband providers from unreasonably discriminating against network traffic subject to <br />reasonable network management.234  Unlike the transparency and no-blocking rules the Commission <br />adopted in 2010, the no unreasonable discrimination rule did not apply to mobile broadband Internet <br />access service providers.235   <br />
114.<br />
<i>D.C. Circuit Opinion in Verizon v. FCC.  </i>The D.C. Circuit vacated the antidiscrimination <br />
rule because it found that the rule improperly relegated fixed broadband providers to common carrier <br />status.236  This violated the statutory ban on common carrier treatment of information service providers<br />because the Commission had classified broadband providers “not as providers of ‘telecommunications <br />services’ but instead as providers of ‘information services.’” 237  The court disagreed with the <br />

The rule stated, “A person engaged in the provision of <br />fixed broadband Internet access service, insofar as such person is so engaged, shall not unreasonably discriminate in <br />transmitting lawful network traffic over a consumer’s broadband Internet access service.  Reasonable network <br />management shall not constitute unreasonable discrimination.”  <i>Id. <br /></i>234 <i>Id</i>.

Commission’s interpretation to the contrary,238 finding that by compelling fixed broadband providers to <br />serve all edge providers who provided content, services, and applications over the Internet without <br />unreasonable discrimination, the rule compelled those providers to hold themselves out “to serve the <br />public indiscriminately”—thus treating them as common carriers.239   <br />
115.<br />
In making its determination, the court relied on its previous decision in <i>Cellco</i>, where it <br />
upheld the Commission’s data roaming requirements against a common carrier challenge.240  The court <br />suggested that had the Commission shown that the “no unreasonable discrimination” standard adopted in <br />the <i>Open Internet Order </i>differed from the “nondiscrimination” standard applicable to common carriers, <br />the rule might have withstood judicial review similar to the data roaming rule at issue in <i>Cellco</i>.241  This is <br />because the rule in <i>Cellco </i>“expressly permit[ted] providers to adapt roaming agreements to <br />‘individualized circumstances without having to hold themselves out to serve all comers indiscriminately <br />on the same or standardized terms.’”242  The court went on to suggest that, unlike the data roaming rules <br />at issue in <i>Cellco</i>, which listed specific factors to consider in a case-by-case determination of whether a <br />data roaming provider’s conduct and offerings were commercially reasonable based on the totality of the <br />circumstances,243 the <i>Open Internet Order </i>did not attempt to “ensure that [the] reasonableness standard <br />

The <i>Cellco </i>court turned aside a facial challenge to the data roaming rules, while reminding <br />the Commission that it could consider “as applied” challenges if the Commission were to apply its rules in a manner <br />that, in fact, relegated network providers to common carrier status.  <i>Id. </i>at 548-49.  We remain cognizant of the <br />Court’s admonition in that circumstance, and in this one.<br />241 <i>Verizon</i>, 740 F.3d at 656.  The court held that the Commission had forfeited the argument, made in footnote 251 <br />of the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, that the antidiscrimination rule did not constitute <i>per se </i>common carriage because the <br />Open Internet rules permitted broadband providers to engage in “reasonable network management,” because the <br />Commission had failed to raise the argument in its appellate brief.  <i>Id.  </i>However, the court went on to explain that <br />the argument would have failed, in any event, because there was no basis on which to distinguish it from the “just <br />and reasonable” legal standard that applies to common carriers.  <i>Id.<br /></i>242 <i>Id. </i>at 652 (citing <i>Cellco</i>, 700 F.3d at 548) (some internal quotations removed).  The data roaming rule <br />specifically states that “providers may negotiate the terms of their roaming arrangements on an individualized <br />basis.”  In other words, providers may offer data roaming arrangements on commercially reasonable terms and <br />conditions tailored to individualized circumstances without having to hold themselves out to serve all comers <br />indiscriminately on the same or standardized terms.  <i>Reexamination of Roaming Obligations of Commercial Mobile <br />Radio Service Providers and Other Providers of Mobile Data Services</i>, WT Docket No. 05-265, Second Report and <br />Order, 26 FCC Rcd 5411, 5433, para. 45 (2011) (<i>Data Roaming Order</i>). <br />243 <i>Data Roaming Order</i>, 26 FCC Rcd at 5452-53, para. 86.  In determining whether negotiations were commercially <br />reasonable, the Commission stated it would consider the following factors: “whether the host provider has <br />responded to the request for negotiation; whether it has engaged in a persistent pattern of stonewalling behavior, and <br />the length of time since the initial request; whether the terms and conditions offered by the host provider are so <br />unreasonable as to be tantamount to a refusal to offer a data roaming arrangement; whether the parties have any <br />roaming arrangements with each other, including roaming for interconnected services such as voice, and the terms <br />of such arrangements; whether the providers involved have had previous data roaming arrangements with similar <br />terms; the level of competitive harm in a given market and the benefits to consumers; the extent and nature of <br />providers’ build-out; significant economic factors, such as whether building another network in the geographic area <br />may be economically infeasible or unrealistic, and the impact of any ‘head-start’ advantages; whether the requesting <br />provider is seeking data roaming for an area where it is already providing facilities-based service; the impact of the <br />terms and conditions on the incentives for either provider to invest in facilities and coverage, services, and service <br />quality; whether there are other options for securing a data roaming arrangement in the areas subject to negotiations <br />

remains flexible.”244  The D.C. Circuit suggested that a rule preventing certain types of conduct by <br />broadband providers might be acceptable, given the manner in which the Commission has classified <br />broadband providers, if the Commission articulated a discrete, flexible standard that prohibited practices <br />that could reasonably be understood to harm Internet openness, while allowing individualized broadband <br />provider practices, akin to the “commercially reasonable” standard adopted by the Commission in the <br />data roaming context.245<br />
<b>2.</b><br />
<p><b>Proposed Elements of an Enforceable Legal Rule</b></p>
<b>a.</b><br />
<p><b>Prohibiting Only Commercially Unreasonable Practices </b></p>
116.<br />
Sound public policy requires that Internet openness be the touchstone of a new legal <br />
standard.  Accordingly, we tentatively conclude that the Commission should adopt a rule requiring <br />broadband providers to use “commercially reasonable” practices in the provision of broadband Internet <br />access service.  Our proposed approach is both more focused and more flexible than the vacated 2010 <br />non-discrimination rule.  It would prohibit as commercially unreasonable those broadband providers’ <br />practices that, based on the totality of the circumstances, threaten to harm Internet openness and all that it <br />protects.  At the same time, it could permit broadband providers to serve customers and carry traffic on an <br />individually negotiated basis, “without having to hold themselves out to serve all comers indiscriminately <br />on the same or standardized terms,” so long as such conduct is commercially reasonable.246  The D.C. <br />Circuit explained that such an approach distinguished the data roaming rules at issue in <i>Cellco </i>from <br />common carrier obligations.247  We seek general comment on this approach, and more targeted comment <br />below.  <br />
117.<br />
With respect to this approach in general, we tentatively conclude that it should operate <br />
separately from the no-blocking rule that we also propose to adopt. In other words, the presence or <br />absence of the no-blocking rule would have no impact on the presence or absence of the “commercially <br />reasonable” standard, and vice versa.  This would mean that conduct acceptable under the no-blocking <br />rule would still be subject to independent examination under the “commercially reasonable” standard. <br />We seek comment on this approach.<br />
118.<br />
The core purpose of the legal standard that we wish to adopt, whether the “commercially <br />
reasonable” standard or another legal formulation, is to effectively employ the authority that the <i>Verizon <br /></i>court held was within the Commission’s power under section 706.  In essence, the court upheld the <br />Commission’s judgment that (1) section 706 grants substantive power to the Commission to take actions, <br />including removing barriers to infrastructure investment and promoting competition in <br />
(Continued from previous page)                                                            <br />and whether alternative data roaming partners are available; events or circumstances beyond either provider’s <br />control that impact either the provision of data roaming or the need for data roaming in the proposed area(s) of <br />coverage; the propagation characteristics of the spectrum licensed to the providers; whether a host provider’s <br />decision not to offer a data roaming arrangement is reasonably based on the fact that the providers are not <br />technologically compatible; whether a host provider’s decision not to enter into a roaming arrangement is reasonably <br />based on the fact that roaming is not technically feasible for the service for which it is requested; whether a host <br />provider’s decision not to enter into a roaming arrangement is reasonably based on the fact that changes to the host <br />network necessary to accommodate the request are not economically reasonable; whether a host provider’s decision <br />not to make a roaming arrangement effective was reasonably based on the fact that the requesting provider’s <br />provision of mobile data service to its own subscribers has not been done with a generation of wireless technology <br />comparable to the technology on which the requesting provider seeks to roam; other special or extenuating <br />circumstances.”  <i>Id.<br /></i>244 <i>Verizon</i>, 740 F.3d at 657.<br />245 <i>Id. <br /></i>246 <i>Id. </i>at 652 (quoting <i>Cellco</i>, 700 F.3d at 548) (internal quotations removed).  <br />247 <i>Id. </i>at 652.<br />

telecommunications markets, that will promote the deployment of broadband networks; (2) the <br />Commission was within its authority to conclude that the “virtuous circle” can be adversely impacted by <br />broadband network practices that, over the long term, depress end user demand, which then threatens<br />broadband deployment; and (3) threats to the open Internet, such as limitations on users to access the <br />content of their choice or speak their views freely, are therefore within the authority of the Commission to <br />curb.  In selecting a legal standard, the Commission not only wishes to avoid subjecting broadband <br />networks to common carriage <i>per se</i>, it also wishes to choose a legal standard whose valid adoption <br />renders unnecessary the adjudication of any question other than whether the adopted legal standard has <br />been violated. This is the distinction between the authority to adopt a standard and its subsequent <br />application.248<br />
119.<br />
Are there alternative legal standards, whether in analogous contexts or otherwise <br />
identified by commenters, that the Commission should consider?  Is there an existing standard that would <br />serve a similar purpose to what we propose here and that would prevent the harms to Internet <br />openness?249  If so, how, and if not, what would any differences be?  Could the Commission modify its <br />approach to “reasonable network management” in ways that would establish a more flexible legal <br />standard that would not constitute common carriage <i>per se</i>?  Commenters advocating alternative legal <br />standards should explain why they are preferable, both in terms of the substantive requirements of the <br />alternative standard (such as how they would address providers’ conduct, offerings, and practices) and its <br />implementation (such as whether and how it may permit individualized decision-making), and how they <br />would protect an open Internet.  And, as to the “commercially reasonable” standard or any other, we seek <br />comment on whether there are sources of law or practice the Commission should rely upon in explaining <br />the meaning and application of that standard.<br />
120.<br />
We also seek comment on how a rule requiring broadband providers to engage in <br />
commercially reasonable practices with respect to delivery of traffic to and from end users should apply <br />in circumstances in which no individualized negotiation occurs between the edge provider and the <br />broadband provider.  To cite just a few of many possible examples, consider a start-up VoIP service, a <br />politically oriented website with an audience of fewer than 100 unique visitors per day, a social <br />networking application narrowly focused on a particular demographic, or peer-to-peer communications <br />among individuals.  Not all of those actors may seek to enter into a contract with a broadband provider;<br />they may simply wish to reach its subscribers.  We seek comment on the impact of this difference on the <br />selection and/or application of the general legal standard.<br />
                                                     <br />
248 It is axiomatic that an as-applied challenge to a rule would invalidate an application of the rule, but the rule itself <br />may otherwise remain broadly applicable. <i>See Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.</i>, 472 U.S. 491, 504 (1985).  Thus, <br />assuming the rule is facially sustained by a reviewing court, the Commission would not be required to re-litigate its <br />underlying determination that adoption of the rule will promote deployment.  47 U.S.C. § 1302(b).  Because the <br />commercially reasonable practices rule requires a determination that an entity did not act in a commercially <br />reasonable manner, the inquiry is, then, not whether the Commission has authority to adopt the regulation, but <br />whether the Commission may enforce the regulation in a particular set of circumstances.  <i>See Colo. Right to Life <br />Comm., Inc. v. Coffman</i>, 498 F.3d 1137, 1146 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding that an as-applied challenge is limited to <br />testing “the application of [a regulation] to the facts of a plaintiff’s concrete case”).  For example, the D.C. Circuit <br />determined that the Commission’s data roaming rule—the legal standard adopted—was facially valid and within the <br />Commission’s authority, but that the application of that standard could still be subject to subsequent challenge.  <i>See <br />Cellco</i>, 700 F.3d at 548.<br />249 For example, Section 628(b) of the Communications Act prohibits cable operators and certain programming <br />vendors from engaging in “unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices, the purpose or <br />effect of which is to hinder significantly or to prevent any multichannel video programming distributor from <br />providing satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming to subscribers or consumers.”  47 U.S.C. <br />§ 548(b).  The Commission has established processes for making case-by-case determinations of whether certain <br />practices are “unfair” under section 628(b) of the Act.  <i>See </i>47 C.F.R. § 76.1003.<br />

121.<br />
As an alternative to our proposed approach, we seek comment on whether the <br />
Commission should adopt a different rule to govern broadband providers’ practices to protect and <br />promote Internet openness.  As mentioned above, a number of parties have expressed concerns about the <br />effect of pay-for-priority agreements on Internet openness.250  How can the Commission ensure that the <br />rule it adopts sufficiently protects against harms to the open Internet, including broadband providers’<br />incentives to disadvantage edge providers or classes of edge providers in ways that would harm Internet <br />openness?  Should the Commission adopt a rule that prohibits unreasonable discrimination and, if so, <br />what legal authority and theories should we rely upon to do so?  If the Commission ultimately adopts a<br />Title II approach, how should the Commission define the rule in light of the requirements under sections <br />201 and 202 of the Act?251    <br />
<b>b.</b><br />
<p><b>Factors to Guide Application of the General Legal Standard</b></p>
122.<br />
Similar to the Commission’s approach in the data roaming context, we propose to <br />
identify factors the Commission can use to administer the proposed commercially reasonable practices <br />standard.252  These pre-defined factors would provide guidance to encourage commercially reasonable <br />individualized practices and, if disputes arise, provide the basis for the Commission to evaluate whether, <br />taking into account the totality of the circumstances on a case-by-case basis as discussed below, a <br />particular practice satisfies the enforceable legal standard.  <br />
123.<br />
We seek comment on this approach and what factors the Commission should adopt to <br />
ensure commercially reasonable practices that will protect and promote Internet openness.  We discuss <br />below several categories of factors, noting that there is considerable overlap between these categories, and <br />that they are not mutually exclusive.  As with the data roaming rule, we tentatively conclude that a review <br />of the totality of the circumstances should be preserved through the creation of a “catch all” factor <br />

that unfair competitive advantages can jeopardize innovation on the edge and impair otherwise lawful <br />delivery of products and services.253  For that reason, we seek comment on how we should construct<br />factors in applying the commercially reasonable legal standard to assess the impact of broadband provider <br />practices on present and future competition.  We understand this competition inquiry to extend beyond an <br />application of antitrust principles to include, for example, the predicted impact of practices on future <br />competition.<br />
125.<br />
To what extent should such competition-oriented factors focus on market structure and <br />
the extent of competition in a given market?  For example, should we consider factors that the <br />Commission has used in case-by-case adjudications under section 628(b) of the Act, which proscribes <br />certain “unfair methods of competition” by cable operators and certain programming vendors?254  Are <br />
                                                     <br />
253 <i>Open Internet Order</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 17909-25, 17927-31, paras. 13-34, 38-42.<br />254 Under section 628(b) of the Act, the Commission has held that determining whether challenged conduct is <br />“unfair” requires “balancing the anticompetitive harms of the challenged conduct against the procompetitive <br />benefits.”  47 U.S.C. § 548(b).  To find a violation under section 628(b) of the Act, the Commission must make two <br />independent judgments.  First, the Commission must determine that the defendant has engaged in unfair methods of <br />competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices.  If the Commission finds unfair acts or practices, then the <br />Commission must determine that the unfair acts or practices had the purpose or effect of hindering significantly or <br />preventing a multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) from providing satellite cable programming to <br />subscribers or consumers.  <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Dakota Telecom Inc. v. CBS Broadcasting</i>, File No. 5381-P, Memorandum <br />Opinion and Order, 14 FCC Rcd 10500 (Cable Services Bur. 1999).  The Commission has determined that specific <br />practices are likely to be prohibited under section 628(b).  For example, the Commission established a rebuttable <br />presumption that an MVPD’s withholding of a terrestrially delivered Regional Sports Network (RSN) from another <br />MVPD creates the harm targeted by section 628(b), based in part on the finding that such programming is “very <br />likely to be both non-replicable and highly valued by consumers.”  <i>Review of the Commission’s Program Access <br />Rules and Examination of Programming Tying Arrangements</i>, MB Docket No. 07-198, First Report and Order, 25 <br />FCC Rcd 746, 782, para. 52 (2010), <i>aff’d in part</i>, <i>Cablevision Sys. Corp. v. FCC</i>, 649 F.3d 695, 703 (D.C. Cir. <br />2011).  Under this presumption, the Commission found that MSG/Cablevision’s withholding of HD versions of the <br />Madison Square Garden RSN from Verizon was “unfair” and created the harm targeted by section 628(b).  <i>See <br />Verizon Tel. Companies &amp; Verizon Servs. Corp. v.

The Commission has also prohibited exclusive arrangements for <br />delivering cable television service to multiple dwelling unit (MDU) properties, given that “[e]xclusivity clauses that <br />run in favor of cable operators typically are a complete bar to entry into MDUs by fiber-deploying LECs such as <br />Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Qwest, as well as [private cable operators].”  <i>Exclusive Service Contracts for Provision of <br />Video Services in Multiple Dwelling Units and Other Real Estate Developments</i>, MB Docket No. 07-51, Report and <br />Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 22 FCC Rcd 20235, 20240 para. 9 (2007), <i>aff’d</i>, <i>Nat’l Cable &amp; </i><br />

there other competition-oriented standards in other contexts (including those outside of <br />telecommunications) that we should look to for guidance?<br />
126.<br />
We propose that the competitive factors should also examine the extent of an entity’s <br />
vertical integration and/or its relationships with affiliated entities. For example, broadband providers <br />sometimes offer an affiliated streaming video service over their broadband network in competition with <br />many other third-party broadband and edge providers’ services.255  How can we ensure that competition is <br />not harmed in such situations?  We note that the no-blocking rule as applied to mobile Internet access <br />service specifically prohibits broadband providers from blocking “applications that compete with the <br />provider’s voice or video telephony services.”256  And the Commission looked to a similar restriction to <br />address harms raised by the Comcast-NBCU transaction.257  In light of such concerns, we propose to <br />adopt a rebuttable presumption that a broadband provider’s exclusive (or effectively exclusive) <br />arrangement prioritizing service to an affiliate would be commercially unreasonable. We seek comment <br />on this proposal.  <br />
127.<br />
More generally, we seek comment on the use of rebuttable presumptions as a tool to <br />
focus attention on the likely impacts of particular practices.  What source or law, either within the <br />Communications Act or in other statutes, would help us craft the creation and use of rebuttable <br />presumptions?258  Are there particular rebuttable presumptions that should be used, for example, dealing <br />with some or all forms of exclusive contracts, or particularized degradation of services?<br />
128.<br />
How can the Commission ensure that parties are acting in a commercially reasonable <br />
manner without foreclosing the creation of pro-competitive opportunities through certain forms of price <br />discrimination or exclusivity agreements?  Should we develop factors modeled in part after those that the <br />Commission uses in determining whether an exclusive contract between a vertically integrated cable <br />operator and cable-programming vendor would serve the public interest?259  Should the Commission <br />adopt a rebuttable presumption that broadband provider conduct that forecloses rivals (of the provider or <br />its affiliates) from the competing marketplace is commercially unreasonable?<br />
(Continued from previous page)                                                            <br /><i>Telecomms. Ass’n v. FCC</i>, 567 F.3d 659 (D.C.

129.<br />
<i>Impact on Consumers.  </i>In addition to the competitive factors, the Commission proposes <br />
to adopt factors to examine the extent to which broadband providers’ practices could harm consumers.  In <br />the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, the Commission looked to, among other things, the extent of transparency and <br />end-user control in assessing whether a practice is unreasonably discriminatory.260  We believe these <br />factors would likewise be relevant to assessing whether a practice is commercially reasonable.  What <br />continued role does the existing or enhanced transparency rule have in ensuring that consumers are <br />receiving correct information from broadband providers and not being misled?<br />
130.<br />
We believe that consumers of broadband access service should have the ability to <br />
exercise meaningful choices.  How can we factor consumer choice into our analysis of what is <br />commercially reasonable?  Should the Commission look for guidance to section 628 of the Act, which <br />makes it unlawful for cable operators and their affiliated satellite cable programming vendors to engage in <br />“unfair or deceptive acts or practices” with certain purposes and effects?261  <br />
131.<br />
<i>Impact on Speech and Civic Engagement.  </i>The open Internet serves as a critical platform <br />
for speech and civic engagement.  As noted above, the ability of citizens and content providers to use this <br />open platform to communicate with one another and express their views to a wide audience at very low <br />costs drives further Internet use, consumer demand, and broadband investment and deployment.262  We <br />therefore propose to adopt a factor or factors in applying the commercially reasonable standard that assess <br />the impact of broadband provider practices on free exercise of speech and civic engagement.  <br />
132.<br />
<i>Technical Characteristics.</i>  We also propose to examine the relevant technical <br />
characteristics associated with broadband providers’ practices.  In the <i>Data Roaming Order</i>, for example, <br />the Commission looked to the technical characteristics of the service at issue, including the technical <br />feasibility of a requested service as well as the technical compatibility of providers’ networks.263  We seek <br />comment on how the Commission should consider such technical characteristics in assessing whether a <br />broadband provider’s practice is commercially reasonable.  The application of the legal standard to <br />satellite Internet access service presents one example.  How should the Commission account for the <br />technical differences between satellite and terrestrial broadband services when examining commercially <br />reasonable behavior for satellite broadband providers?  <br />
133.<br />
<i>“Good Faith” Negotiation.  </i>The Commission has imposed good faith negotiation <br />
requirements in a variety of contexts.  For example, the Commission explicitly requires television <br />broadcasters and multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) to negotiate retransmission <br />consent agreements in good faith.264   The Commission also mandated good faith negotiations for dealings <br />between certain spectrum licensees.265  Would adopting a similar framework for evaluating negotiations <br />                                                     <br />

between parties in the open Internet context serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity? How <br />should such a “good faith” test be applied where parties do not seek to enter into contractual relationships <br />with each other?<br />
134.<br />
<i>Industry Practices. </i>How, if at all, should the fact that conduct is an industry practice <br />
impact the application of the “commercially reasonable” rule?  What should be treated as an “industry <br />practice”?  For example, should that term be limited to express standards adopted by standards-setting <br />organizations or similar entities?  If so, should the make-up or processes used by such a standards-setting <br />organization be considered?  If not, how should the existence of an “industry practice” be effectively <br />established for purposes of the application of the “commercially reasonable” rule, and how should the <br />Commission best evaluate potential harms to competition arising from coordinated conduct in a market <br />with a limited number of participants?266<br />
135.<br />
<i>Other Factors</i>.  We seek comment on any additional factors the Commission should <br />
consider in assessing whether a particular practice or set of practices by a broadband provider is <br />commercially reasonable, given the importance of preventing harms to an open Internet.  Are there other <br />factors that the Commission adopted in the <i>Data Roaming Order </i>that we should incorporate here?267  <br />How can the Commission best include a factor to capture special or extenuating circumstances to ensure <br />that it can take into account the totality of the circumstances, particularly given the rapid evolution of the<br />Internet marketplace and technology?  <br />
<b>c.</b><br />
<p><b>Case-by-Case Evaluations for Commercial Reasonableness</b></p>
136.<br />
As discussed,268 we tentatively conclude that we will adopt a case-by-case approach,<br />
considering the totality of the circumstances, when analyzing whether conduct satisfies the proposed<br />commercially reasonable legal standard, or another legal standard ultimately adopted.  We believe that, in <br />conjunction with the factors listed above, this approach will provide the advantage of certainty and <br />guidance to broadband providers and edge providers—particularly smaller entities that might lack <br />experience dealing with broadband providers—while also allowing parties flexibility in their <br />individualized dealings.  We seek comment on whether there is another avenue or mechanism we should <br />use when evaluating commercial reasonableness.<br />

<p><b>Potential Conduct That Is <i>Per Se </i></b></p><p><b>Commercially Unreasonable </b></p>
137.<br />
In <i>Southwestern Cable</i>, the Supreme Court concluded that a Commission requirement <br />
that cable systems carry local broadcast signals did not constitute common carriage even though the <br />Commission’s rule applied to all cable systems in defined circumstances.  As the Supreme Court later <br />noted, that holding “was limited to remedying a specific perceived evil [that] did not amount to a duty to <br />hold out facilities indifferently for public use.”269 In <i>Verizon</i>, the D.C. Circuit likewise explained that the <br /><i>Southwestern Cable </i>regulation “imposed no obligation on cable operators to hold their facilities open to <br />the public generally, but only to certain broadcasters if and when cable operators acted in ways that might <br />harm those broadcasters.”270 Thus, consistent with Supreme Court precedent and the <i>Verizon </i>decision, <br />the Commission may be able to identify specific practices that do not satisfy the commercially reasonable <br />
(Continued from previous page)                                                            <br /><i>Good Faith Negotiations Among Economic Area Licensees and Incumbent Licensees in the Upper 200 Channels of <br />the 800 MHz Band</i>, PR Docket No. 93-144, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 16 FCC Rcd 4882, 4884, para. 4 <br />(2001).<br />266 <i>See infra </i>para. 176; <i>Open Internet Order</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 17946, para. 74.<br />267 <i>See supra </i>n.243.<br />268 <i>See supra </i>para. 61; <i>see also infra </i>Section III.H.<br />269 <i>FCC v.

legal standard.  For example, we note that the data roaming rule upheld by the D.C. Circuit’s <i>Cellco<br /></i>decision states that “[c]onduct that unreasonably restrains trade . . . is not commercially reasonable.”271<br />Similarly, the Commission recently concluded that certain joint activities between certain television <br />stations, which are not regulated as common carriers, in the negotiation of retransmission consent fees are <br />a <i>per se </i>violation of the requirement of “good faith” negotiation.272 Are there any practices that, <br />consistent with the <i>Verizon </i>court’s reasoning, could be viewed as <i>per se </i>commercially unreasonable? <br />
138.<br />
Some have suggested that the Commission go even beyond the requirements of the <i>Open </i><br />
<i>Internet Order </i>to impose flat bans on pay-for-priority service.273  We seek comment on these suggestions, <br />including whether all pay-for-priority practices, or some of them, could be treated as <i>per se </i>violations of <br />the commercially reasonable standard or under any other standard based on any source of legal <br />authority.274  We emphasize that section 706 could not be used to reach some conduct under this judicially<br />recognized approach to circumvent the principle that the proposed rules will not, in any circumstances, <br />constitute common carriage <i>per se</i>.  If the Commission were to ultimately rely on a source of authority <br />other than section 706 to adopt a legal standard for broadband provider practices, such as Title II, we seek <br />comment on whether and, if so, how we should prohibit all, or some, pay-for-priority arrangements, <br />consistent with our authority, to protect and promote Internet openness. <br />
<b>4.</b><br />
<p><b>Potential Safe Harbors</b></p>
139.<br />
Similar to the approach of identifying practices <i>ex ante </i>that would not satisfy the <br />
commercially reasonable legal standard, the Commission may be able to identify specific services that <br />would be treated separately from the application of the commercially reasonable legal standard.  We seek <br />comment on this approach and how the services below should be considered under such an approach.  <br />
140.<br />
<i>Application to Mobile Broadband. </i>The Commission chose not to apply its no <br />
unreasonable discrimination rule to mobile broadband providers in 2010 based on considerations <br />including the rapidly evolving nature of mobile technologies, the increased amount of consumer choice in <br />mobile broadband services, and operational constraints that put greater pressure on the concept of <br />reasonable network management for mobile broadband services.275 We have tentatively concluded that <br />we will continue that approach in the proposed rules.276 Alternatively, should the Commission account <br />for different characteristics of mobile service as a factor in its application of the commercially reasonable <br />standard, subject to mobile providers’ reasonable network management?  How would maintaining our <br />previous approach for mobile broadband affect end users across different demographic groups, including <br />end users who rely solely on mobile broadband for Internet access?277<br />
141.<br />
<i>Non</i>-<i>exclusive</i>, <i>non-affiliated agreements.</i>  AT&amp;T has suggested that the Commission<br />
exclude from its review of particular practices any agreement between a broadband provider and an edge<br />provider if the agreement is not exclusive and if the edge provider is not an affiliate of the broadband <br />provider.  AT&amp;T explains that subjecting broadband providers to case-by-case scrutiny in such cases <br />“would unnecessarily impede efficient and pro-consumer arms-length commercial dealings.”278 We seek <br />                                                     <br />

<p><b>Legal Authority</b></p>
142.<br />
In this Notice, we propose to adopt rules to protect and promote the open Internet.  For <br />
the reasons set forth below, we believe we have ample authority to do so.279  We propose that the <br />Commission exercise its authority under section 706, consistent with the D.C. Circuit’s opinion in <br /><i>Verizon v. FCC</i>, to adopt our proposed rules.  We also seek comment on the nature and the extent of the <br />Commission’s authority to adopt open Internet rules relying on Title II, and other possible sources of <br />authority, including Title III.  Additionally, we seek comment on the Commission's authority under any of <br />the legal theories discussed below to address any transition or implementation issues associated with any <br />open Internet rules adopted in this proceeding, such as the effect on existing agreements.280<br />
<b>1.</b><br />
<p><b>Section 706</b></p>
143.<br />
We seek comment on our authority under section 706.281  We interpret sections 706(a) <br />
and (b) as independent and overlapping grants of authority that give the Commission the flexibility to <br />encourage deployment of broadband Internet access service through a variety of regulatory methods, <br />including removal of barriers to infrastructure investment and promoting competition in the <br />telecommunications market, and, in the case of section 706(b), giving the Commission the authority to act <br />swiftly when it makes a negative finding of adequate deployment.282  The rules we propose today would <br />be authorized by sections 706(a) and (b) because they would “encourage the deployment” of advanced <br />telecommunications capability by promoting competition in the telecommunications market and removing <br />barriers to infrastructure investment.283  We also seek comment on the relevant differences between <br />

sections 706(a) and (b) and how, if at all, those differences should impact our exercise of authority <br />here.284  <br />
144.<br />
To the extent that we rely on our authority under section 706(b), we seek comment on <br />
how we should treat the existence of and the findings in the Commission’s Broadband Progress Reports <br />for the purposes of this proceeding.  Could and should the Commission incorporate findings that satisfy <br />section 706(b) in this proceeding?  Finally, we seek comment on the extent to which the disparity between <br />metropolitan areas and rural deployment of broadband or within metropolitan areas should impact our <br />conclusions as to whether advanced telecommunications capability is being reasonably and timely <br />deployed.<br />
145.<br />
We also seek comment on how to construe the specific terms and definitions in section <br />
706.  For example, “advanced telecommunications capability” is defined “without regard to any <br />transmission media or technology, as high-speed, switched, broadband telecommunications capability that <br />enables users to originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video telecommunications <br />using any technology.”285  It is clear that broadband Internet access service is such “advanced <br />telecommunications capability,” but we also seek comment on what other broadband-enabled services <br />may fall within the definition of “advanced telecommunications capability.”286  Should the Commission <br />interpret the term “advanced telecommunications capability” to require that certain practices accompany a <br />broadband provider’s deployment to ensure that end users receive “high-speed, switched, broadband <br />telecommunications capability that enables users to originate and receive high-quality voice, data, <br />graphics, and video telecommunications?”  In addition, we note that Congress did not define <br />“deployment.”  We believe Congress intended this term to be construed broadly, and thus, consistent with <br />precedent, we have interpreted it to include the extension of networks as well as the extension of the <br />capabilities and capacities of those networks.287  <br />
                                                     <br />
284 There are significant differences between the authorities granted in each provision.  For example, while both <br />section 706(a) and (b) permit the Commission to enact measures that promote competition in the <br />telecommunications market, section 706(b) permits the Commission to act by promoting competition in the <br />“telecommunications market” while section 706(a) limits the Commission to promoting competition in the “local <br />telecommunications market.” Also, while section 706(a) gives the Commission general authority to encourage the <br />deployment of broadband regardless of findings under section 706(b), section 706(b) gives the Commission <br />authority to take “immediate action.”  <i>Compare </i>47 U.S.C. § 1302(a) (“The Commission . . . shall encourage the <br />deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans . . . by <br />utilizing, in a manner consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, price cap regulation, regulatory <br />forbearance, measures that promote competition in the local telecommunications market, or other regulating <br />methods that remove barriers to infrastructure investment.”), <i>with </i>47 U.S.C. § 1302(b) (“If the Commission[] <br />determin[es] [that advanced telecommunications capability is not being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable <br />and timely fashion], it shall take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers <br />to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market.”). <br />285 47 U.S.C. § 1302(d)(1).<br />286 <i>See Open Internet Order</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 17968, para. 117 (“‘[A]dvanced telecommunications capability,’ as <br />defined in the statute, includes broadband Internet access.”); <i>National Broadband Plan for our Future</i>, GN Docket <br />No. 09-51, Notice of Inquiry, 24 FCC Rcd 4342, 4390, Appx. para. 14 (2009) (stating that “advanced <br />telecommunications capability” includes broadband Internet access); <i>Inquiry Concerning the Deployment of <br />Advanced Telecommunications Capability to All Americans in a Reasonable and Timely Fashion</i>, CC Docket No. <br />98-146, Report, 14 FCC Rcd 2398, 2400, paras. 1, 20 (1999) (stating that section 706 addresses “the deployment of <br />broadband capability”).  Even when broadband Internet access is provided as an “information service” rather than a <br />“telecommunications service,<i>” see Nat’l Cable &amp; Telecomms. Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs.</i>, 545 U.S. 967, 977-<br />78 (2005), it involves “telecommunications.”  47 U.S.C. § 153(24).<br />287 <i>See Inquiry Concerning the Deployment of Advanced Telecommunications Capability to All Americans in a <br />Reasonable and Timely Fashion</i>, <i>and Possible Steps to Accelerate Such Deployment Pursuant to Section 706 of the <br />Telecommunications Act of 1996</i>, <i>as Amended by the Broadband Data Improvement Act</i>, GN Docket No. 11-121, <br />

In section 230(b) of the Communications Act, Congress also set forth statutory <br />
“polic[ies] of the United States”:  to “promote the continued development of the Internet,” to promote <br />“technologies which maximize user control over what information is received” over the Internet, and to <br />“preserve the vibrant and competitive free market <i>that presently exists for the Internet</i>, unfettered by <br />Federal or State regulation.”288  We continue to believe the Commission’s interpretation of section 706 is <br />bolstered by these congressional policies.289  We seek comment on how the Commission should read <br />section 230(b) in exercising its section 706 authority.<br />

We also seek comment generally on how the court’s decision in <i>Verizon v. FCC </i>should <br />

<i>Title II—Revisiting the Classification of Broadband Internet Access Service.  </i>In a series <br />
of decisions beginning in 2002, the Commission has classified broadband Internet access service offered <br />over cable modem,297 DSL and other wireline facilities,298 wireless facilities,299 and power lines300 as an <br />information service, which is not subject to Title II and cannot be regulated as common carrier service.301  <br />In 2010, following the D.C. Circuit’s <i>Comcast </i>decision, the Commission issued a Notice of Inquiry (<i>2010 <br />NOI</i>) that, among other things, asked whether the Commission should revisit these decisions and classify <br />a telecommunications component service of wired broadband Internet access service as a <br />“telecommunications service.”302  The Commission also asked whether it should similarly alter its <br />approach to wireless broadband Internet access service, noting that section 332 requires that wireless <br />services that meet the definition of “commercial mobile service”303 be regulated as common carriers <br />                                                     <br />

under Title II.304  In response, the Commission received substantial comments on these issues.  We now <br />seek further and updated comment on whether the Commission should revisit its prior classification <br />decisions and apply Title II to broadband Internet access service (or components thereof).  How would <br />such a reclassification approach serve our goal to protect and promote Internet openness?  What would be <br />the legal bases and theories for particular open Internet rules adopted pursuant to such an approach?  <br />Would reclassification and applying Title II for the purpose of protecting and promoting Internet <br />openness impact the Commission’s overall policy goals and, if so, how?   <br />
150.<br />
What factors should the Commission keep in mind as it considers whether to revisit its <br />
prior decisions?  Have there been changes to the broadband marketplace that should lead us to reconsider <br />our prior classification decisions?  To what extent is any telecommunications component of that service <br />integrated with applications and other offerings, such that they are “inextricably intertwined” with the <br />underlying connectivity service?305  Is broadband Internet access service (or any telecommunications <br />component thereof) held out “for a fee directly to the public, or to such classes of users as to be <br />effectively available directly to the public?”306  If not, should the Commission compel the offering of such <br />functionality on a common carrier basis even if not offered as such?  For mobile broadband Internet <br />access service, does that service fit within the definition of “commercial mobile service”?307 We also note <br />that on May 14, 2014, Representative Henry Waxman, Ranking Member of the Committee on Energy and <br />Commerce of the U.S. House of Representatives, sent a letter to Chairman Wheeler proposing an <br />approach to protecting the open Internet whereby the Commission would proceed under section 706 but <br />use Title II as a “backstop authority.”308  We seek comment on the viability of that approach.<br />
151.<br />
<i>Title II—Classification of the Broadband Providers’ Service to Edge Providers</i>.  Separate <br />
from the reclassification of “broadband Internet access service,” we seek comment on how the <br />Commission should consider broadband providers’ service to edge providers and whether that service (or <br />some portion of it) is subject to Title II regulation.  As mentioned above, in <i>Verizon</i>, the D.C. Circuit <br />stated that “broadband providers furnish a service to edge providers, thus undoubtedly functioning as <br />
(Continued from previous page)                                                            <br />as a list of “mobile services that shall be treated as common carriage services and regulated as commercial mobile <br />radio services . . . pursuant to Section 332 of the Communications Act.”  47 C.F.R. § 20.9(a).<br />304 <i>2010 NOI</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 7907-09, paras. 101-05.<br />305 <i>Brand X</i>, 545 U.S. at 978.<br />306 47 U.S.C. § 153(46).  A key feature of whether a provider is engaged in common carriage is if it “make[s] <br />capacity available to the public indifferently”; it can also be compelled to offer service on a common carrier basis if <br />“the public interest requires common carrier operation of the proposed facility.” <i>Cable &amp; Wireless PLC</i>, File No. <br />SCL-96-005, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 12 FCC Rcd 8516, 8522, paras. 14-15 (1997); <i>see also U.S. <br />Telecom Ass’n v. FCC</i>, 295 F.3d 1326, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (“[C]ommon carrier status turns on: (1) whether the <br />carrier ‘holds himself out to serve indifferently all potential users’; and (2) whether the carrier allows ‘customers to <br />transmit intelligence of their own design and choosing.’” (citation omitted)); <i>Virgin Islands Tel.

Whether a provider <br />has made a common carriage offering “must be determined on a case-by-case basis.”  <i>Bright House Networks</i>, <i>LLC</i>,<br /><i>et al. v.

edge providers’ ‘carriers.’”309  We understand such service to include the flow of Internet traffic on the <br />broadband providers’ own network, and not how it gets to the broadband providers’ networks.  The <br />Commission in the <i>Open Internet Order </i>understood the 2010 rules to regulate “broadband Internet access <br />service,” which the Commission classified as an information service.  That service, however, is by <br />definition a “mass-market retail service” providing the capability to send and receive data from “all <br />Internet end points.”310  Does the “service” contemplated by the court between broadband providers and <br />edge providers fit that definition?  We seek comment on whether and, if so how, the Commission should <br />separately identify and classify a broadband service that is furnished by broadband providers’ to edge <br />providers in order to protect and promote Internet openness.  <br />
152.<br />
Some have made proposals suggesting that the Commission could apply Title II to such <br />
services to achieve our open Internet objectives.  For example, on May 5, 2014, Mozilla filed a petition <br />requesting that the Commission (1) recognize remote delivery services in terminating access networks; <br />(2) classify these services as “telecommunications services” under Title II of the Act; and (3) forbear from <br />any “inapplicable or undesirable provisions of Title II” for such services.311  Mozilla states that, unlike the <br />end-user facing broadband services the Commission has classified as information services, the<br />Commission has not classified the service that broadband Internet providers to remote endpoints, <br />particularly to entities not in privity with the broadband provider.312  These services, Mozilla argues, can <br />and should be classified as telecommunications services, subject to whatever Title II regulations the <br />Commission deems appropriate.313  Similarly, academics from Columbia University have submitted an <br />alternate proposal to classify Internet-facing services that a broadband provider offers.314  This theory <br />would split broadband Internet access service into two components:  first, the subscriber’s “request [for] <br />data from a third-party provider; and second, the content provider’s response to the subscriber.”315  The <br />proposal would classify the latter “sender-side” traffic, sent in response to a broadband provider’s <br />customer’s request as a telecommunications service, subject to Title II.316  According to the proposal, this <br />is a stand-alone offer of telecommunications—transmission between points specified by the end-user.317  <br />We seek comment on these proposals and other suggestions for how the Commission could identify and <br />classify such services and apply Title II to achieve our goals of protecting and promoting Internet <br />openness.<br />
153.<br />
<i>Title II—Forbearance</i>.  If the Commission were to reclassify broadband Internet access <br />
service as described above or classify a separate broadband service provided to edge providers as a <br />“telecommunications service,” such a service would then be subject to all of the requirements of the Act <br />and Commission rules that would flow from the classification of a service as a telecommunications <br />service or common carrier service.

to strike the right balance between minimizing the regulatory burden on providers and ensuring that the <br />public interest is served.318  For mobile broadband services, we seek comment on whether and how the <br />Commission should apply section 332(c)(1) in addition to section 10 forbearance.319<br />
154.<br />
In the <i>2010 NOI</i>, the Commission contemplated that, if it were to classify the Internet <br />
connectivity component of broadband Internet access service, it would forbear from applying all but a <br />handful of core statutory provisions—sections 201, 202, 208, and 254—to the service.320  In addition, the <br />Commission identified sections 222 and 255 as provisions that could be excluded from forbearance, <br />noting that they have “attracted longstanding and broad support in the broadband context.”321  We <br />received considerable comment in that proceeding and seek further and updated comment.322  <br />Commenters should list and explain which provisions should be exempt from forbearance and which <br />should receive it in order to protect and promote Internet openness.  Commenters should also detail which <br />services should receive forbearance, list the provisions from which they believe the Commission should <br />forbear, and provide justification for the forbearance.  Commenters should also define the relevant <br />geographic and product markets in which the services or providers should receive forbearance.  <br />
155.<br />
For mobile broadband services, we also seek comment on the extent to which forbearance <br />
should apply, if the Commission were to classify mobile broadband Internet access service as a CMRS <br />service subject to Title II.  The <i>2010 NOI </i>also asked whether the Commission could and should apply <br />section 332(c)(1) as well as section 10 in its forbearance analysis for mobile services.323  We received <br />considerable comment in that proceeding and seek further and updated comment here.   <br />
<b>3.</b><br />
<p><b>Other Sources of Authority</b></p>
156.<br />
<i>Title III.  </i>We further seek comment on the Commission’s authority to adopt open Internet <br />
rules for mobile broadband services under Title III of the Communications Act.  The Supreme Court has <br />found that Title III endows the Commission with “expansive powers” and a “comprehensive mandate to <br />
                                                     <br />
318 Section 10 of the Communications Act provides that the Commission shall forbear from applying a provision of <br />the Act or the Commission’s rules to a telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service (or a class thereof)  <br />if:  (1) enforcement of that provision is not necessary to ensure just, reasonable, and non-discriminatory practices; <br />(2) enforcement is not necessary to protect consumers; and (3) forbearance is consistent with the public interest.  <br />47 U.S.C. § 160(a).  “In making the determination under subsection (a)(3) [that forbearance is in the public interest,] <br />the Commission shall consider whether forbearance from enforcing the provision or regulation will promote <br />competitive market conditions, including the extent to which such forbearance will enhance competition among <br />providers of telecommunications services.  If the Commission determines that such forbearance will promote <br />competition among providers of telecommunications services, that determination may be the basis for a Commission <br />finding that forbearance is in the public interest.”  47 U.S.C. § 160(b).  <br />319 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(1).  Under that provision, the Commission may render provisions other than section 201, 202, <br />or 208 inapplicable “only if the Commission determines that—(i) enforcement of such provision is not necessary in <br />order to ensure that the charges, practices, classifications, or regulations for or in connection with that service are <br />just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory; (ii) enforcement of such provision is not <br />necessary for the protection of consumers; and (iii) specifying such provision is consistent with the public interest.”  <br /><i>Id.<br /></i>320 <i>2010 NOI</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 7895, para. 68.<br />321 <i>Id.<br /></i>322 <i>See </i>Letter from Robert Quinn, AT&amp;T to Marlene H.

‘encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest.’”324  Section 303 of the Act, in <br />particular, authorizes the Commission to exercise its authority as “the public interest, convenience, and <br />necessity requires” to “[p]rescribe the nature of the service to be rendered by each class of licensed <br />stations and each station within any class,” and to establish obligations, not inconsistent with law, as may <br />be necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act .325  It further directs the Commission to “generally <br />encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest.”326  Likewise, section 316 of <br />the Act authorizes the Commission to adopt “new conditions on existing licensees” when taking such <br />action will “promote the public interest, convenience, and necessity.”327  The Commission may exercise <br />this authority on a license-by-license basis or through a rulemaking,328 even if the affected licenses were <br />awarded at auction.329<br />
157.<br />
We find that these provisions provide authority for the Commission to adopt open <br />
Internet rules for mobile broadband service providers.  Particularly, we find that it is within our authority <br />to “prescribe the nature of the service to be rendered by each class of licensed stations and each station <br />within any class,” consistent with what the “public interest, convenience, and necessity requires” to apply <br />open Internet rules to mobile broadband service providers.330  We seek comment on this interpretation of <br />our Title III authority.  <br />
158.<br />
<i>Other Sources of Authority.  </i>We seek comment on other sources of authority that the <br />
Commission may utilize to underpin the adoption of these rules.  For example, the <i>Open Internet Order<br /></i>delineated a number of arguments for authority under a variety of statutory provisions.331  We also seek <br />comment on the theory that the Commission may underpin open Internet rules by using its discretion to <br />define the scope of common carriage.332  In addition, we seek comment on the Commission’s authority to <br />adopt rules under the World Trade Organization’s Basic Agreement on Trade in Telecommunications.333  <br />We seek comment on the efficacy of those, and other justifications for the rules we propose adopting <br />here.  <br />
<b>4.</b><br />
<p><b>Constitutional Considerations</b></p>
159.<br />
Finally we seek comment on other legal limitations and barriers to adoption of the rules <br />
we propose today, including First Amendment and Due Process considerations.  In the <i>Open Internet <br />Order</i>, the Commission concluded that “broadband providers typically are best described not as <br />‘speakers,’ but rather as conduits for speech,” and that the open Internet rules therefore did not implicate <br />

broadband providers’ First Amendment rights.334  The Commission also found that even if the rules “did <br />implicate expressive activity, they would not violate the First Amendment”335 because they would <br />advance an important government interest—“ensur[ing] the public’s access to a multiplicity of <br />information sources and maximiz[ing] the Internet’s potential to further the public interest”—without <br />burdening “‘substantially more speech than is necessary.’”336  We seek comment on these findings.<i>  </i>We <br />do not anticipate constitutional, statutory, or other legal barriers to adopting the rules we propose today, <br />but we nonetheless seek comment on these matters.  Are there modifications we could make to the <br />proposals we make today that would avoid constitutional questions?  <br />
<p><b>G.</b></p>
<p><b>Other Laws and Considerations</b></p>
160.<br />
The <i>Open Internet Order </i>provided that the open Internet rules did not alter broadband <br />
providers’ rights or obligations with respect to other laws or safety and security considerations.337  The <br />Commission further established that the rules did not prohibit broadband providers from making <br />reasonable efforts to address transfers of unlawful content and unlawful transfers of content.338  We <br />tentatively conclude that this continues to be the correct approach in light of the rules proposed in today’s <br />Notice.  We therefore propose to retain these regulations without modification.  We seek comment on this <br />tentative conclusion.<br />
<p><b>H.</b></p>
<p><b>Enforcement and Dispute Resolution</b></p>
<b>1.</b><br />
<p><b>Background</b></p>
161.<br />
The <i>Open Internet Order </i>allowed parties to file informal complaints pursuant to section <br />
1.41 of the Commission’s rules and promulgated a set of formal complaint rules.339 The formal complaint <br />rules give the Commission flexibility to shift the burden of proof or production where appropriate and to <br />structure and streamline the process to the extent possible.340 Due to the technical nature of potential <br />disputes, however, the <i>Open Internet Order </i>stressed the importance of direct negotiations and <br />consultation with independent technical bodies in hope that parties would be able to resolve disputes <br />before availing themselves of the complaint processes.341 Thus, the policy of the Commission has been to <br />encourage the filing of informal, rather than formal, complaints, and thus it was not surprising that the <br />Commission did not receive any formal complaints following the adoption of the <i>Open Internet Order</i>.  <br />As noted above, the Commission has received many informal complaints from consumers alleging <br />violations of the <i>Open Internet Order.  </i>In addition, the Commission takes notice of public commentary <br />and events, which may lead the Enforcement Bureau to initiate its own investigation.  We seek comment <br />on the efficiency and functionality of the complaint processes adopted in, and used pursuant to, the <i>Open <br />Internet Order. </i><br />
<b>2.</b><br />
<p><b>Designing an Effective Enforcement Process</b></p>
162.<br />
The <i>Verizon </i>decision and our earlier data roaming rules provide a blueprint for the <br />
creation of a dispute resolution process to govern the rules we propose today to protect and promote the <br />open Internet.  Of course, there are significant potential differences between the data roaming and open <br />
                                                     <br />

Internet environments.  For example, in <i>Cellco</i>, the D.C. Circuit considered a circumstance in which an <br />identified party, a wireless carrier, would desire to enter into a business arrangement with another <br />identified party, another wireless carrier.  The rule at issue was designed to create circumstances that both <br />incented individualized bargaining and, in specific circumstances, curbed the limits of such negotiation <br />where necessary to serve the public interest.  A similar circumstance could arise in the open Internet <br />context, if for example, an app developer wished to enter into a contractual arrangement with a broadband <br />provider.  But it is just as possible that the entity that feels aggrieved by an alleged violation of an open <br />Internet rule does not seek a direct contractual relationship with a broadband provider.  That could arise, <br />for example, if a website is blocked or if an edge provider feels that it is being harmed by differential <br />treatment afforded by a broadband provider to its own affiliate.  For this reason, the dispute resolution <br />mechanism adopted by the Commission to enforce our proposed open Internet rules should be designed to <br />operate between parties that do not necessarily desire to enter into a binding agreement.  <br />
163.<br />
We tentatively conclude that an effective institutional design for the rules proposed in <br />
today’s Notice must include at least three elements.  <i>First</i>, there must be a mechanism to provide legal <br />certainty, so that broadband providers, end users and edge providers alike can better plan their activities in <br />light of clear Commission guidance.  <i>Second</i>, there must be flexibility to consider the totality of the facts <br />in an environment of dynamic innovation.  <i>Third</i>, there must be effective access to dispute resolutions by <br />end users and edge providers alike.  We seek comment on these elements.  Are there others that should be <br />considered?  Should any be eliminated?  What forms of dispute resolution would be the best strategy to <br />implement “data-driven decision-making”?342  <br />
164.<br />
We believe we have ample legal authority to design an effective enforcement and dispute <br />
resolution process, whether the Commission ultimately relies on section 706, Title II, or another source of <br />legal authority.  We seek comment on whether and how, if at all, the source of the Commission’s legal <br />authority would affect our dispute resolution and enforcement proposals.343  <br />
<b>a.</b><br />
<p><b>Legal Certainty</b></p>
165.<br />
The Commission has a responsibility to provide certainty, guidance, and predictability to <br />
the marketplace as we protect and promote the open Internet.  The most important form of guidance is, of <br />course, the adoption by the Commission of a particular legal standard in the forthcoming rulemaking.  As <br />with the “commercially reasonable” standard employed in our data roaming rule, the purpose of such a <br />legal standard is allow broadband providers, end users, and edge providers to measure broadband-<br />provider conduct against a known rule of law, both prospectively and retroactively.  Under the existing <br />rules, formal complaints would also result in Commission orders that would both decide a specific <br />complaint and provide useful guidance on the application of our proposed open Internet rules—<br />particularly in those cases where the adjudicated set of facts is representative of a larger industry practice.  <br />What other forms of guidance would be helpful?  For example, is there value in establishing a business-<br />review-letter approach similar to that of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, whereby <br />entities concerned about certain practices under the new rules may ask the Commission for a statement of <br />its current enforcement intentions with respect to that conduct and by which the Commission would <br />publish both the request for review and its response?344  If adopted, would it make sense to have such a <br />prospective review process be administered jointly by the Enforcement Bureau and the Office of General <br />Counsel, or should such prospective reviews be considered by the full Commission?  Should such <br />guidance be binding or non-binding?  How might petitions for declaratory ruling be helpful?<br />

166.<br />
<i>Non-Binding Staff Opinions.  </i>Are there other mechanisms by which the Commission can <br />
provide guidance before broadband providers initiate practices that are within the scope of the open <br />Internet rules?  For example, the Commission could designate certain staff to offer parties non-binding <br />views on the likelihood that a particular practice by a broadband provider is commercially reasonable or <br />commercially unreasonable (assuming that were the applicable legal standard ultimately adopted).  The <br />Commission has some experience with this non-binding, advisory approach to interpretation of its <br />rules.345 While this type of informal guidance from staff is not binding, it may provide parties with <br />helpful information as they consider whether and how to resolve a dispute privately and outside of the <br />complaint process.  Should we establish a similar process for helping parties anticipate issues or resolve <br />disputes that might arise under our proposed open Internet rules?  If so, should the non-binding guidance <br />be made public in any way, or should it provide a confidential basis for early consultation?  We <br />emphasize that these sorts of non-binding processes would always be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the <br />right of parties to seek binding determinations from the Commission through the formal or informal <br />complaint process, declaratory rulings, or other mechanisms we adopt to resolve disputes and allegations <br />of violations of our open Internet rules.  <br />
167.<br />
<i>Enforcement Advisories.  </i>Another type of guidance can come in the form of enforcement <br />
advisories.  For example, the Enforcement Bureau and the Office of General Counsel issued an <br />enforcement advisory in 2011, providing additional insight into the application of the transparency rule.346<br />Is it helpful to have these bureaus issue such advisories periodically where issues of potential general <br />application come to, or are brought to, their attention?  Should such enforcement advisories be considered <br />binding policy of the Commission, or merely a recitation of staff views?<br />
<b>b.</b><br />
<p><b>Flexibility</b></p>
168.<br />
Our process for promoting and protecting Internet openness through the rules we propose <br />
today must be flexible enough to account for the totality of circumstances, including Internet evolution <br />and innovation from all sources over time.  In the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, the Commission stated that it <br />would make certain determinations on a case-by-case basis.347 The Commission also stated in the <i>Data <br />Roaming Order </i>that it would determine whether the terms and conditions of a proffered data roaming <br />arrangement were commercially reasonable on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the totality <br />of the circumstances.348  Based on the Commission’s precedent in using this decision-making process, we <br />tentatively conclude that we will adopt a similar case-by-case analysis and consider the totality of the <br />circumstances to consider alleged violations of our proposed open Internet rules.  Such an approach <br />would, for example, allow the Commission to consider any sources of innovation when analyzing <br />whether conduct meets the legal standard ultimately adopted by the Commission.  Moreover, this <br />approach helps to ensure that, as new circumstances exist, the Commission and interested parties will be <br />advantaged by a culture of learning that, drawing on the strengths of common-law reasoning, reflects the <br />experiences of the present, as well as the logic of the past.349  We seek comment on whether the <br />

The law embodies the <br />story of a nation’s development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the <br />

combination of a certain legal standard and a case-by-case approach provides the best means of both <br />providing guidance and cabining administrative discretion, while ensuring that a system of dispute <br />resolution is both focused on facts and founded on the strengths of common-law reasoning.<br />
169.<br />
<i>Fact Finding Processes. </i>In implementing either an informal or formal complaint <br />
process, how should the Commission structure its fact-finding processes? What level of evidence should <br />be required in order to bring a claim?  Are there other circumstances where initial pleading standards or <br />burdens of production should be either higher or lower?  In general, what is the showing required for the <br />burden of production shift from the party bringing the claim to the other party in a dispute?  Should <br />interim relief be available?  Should the process permit parties to seek expedited treatment of claims and, if <br />so, under what circumstances?<br />
<b>c.</b><br />
<p><b>Effective Access to Dispute Resolution  </b></p>
170.<br />
To be effective in protecting and promoting Internet openness, the process for enforcing <br />
the rules we propose today must be accessible to a diverse array of affected parties.  As noted above, the <br /><i>Open Internet Order </i>contemplated informal and formal complaints but did not include any alternative <br />mechanisms for either providing guidance beforehand or resolution in the wake of a challenge to an <br />existing practice.  But, as also noted above, the rules proposed in today’s Notice will operate in an <br />environment in which a complaining party may not have sought, or may not even want, to enter into a <br />contractual arrangement with a broadband provider.  Moreover, the ability of edge providers to effectively <br />access a dispute resolution is important to the administrative effectiveness of any legal regime that the <br />Commission might adopt.  To what extent should the structure of edge provider market segments impact <br />the kind of regime that the Commission adopts?  For example, although 17 broadband access providers <br />accounted for about 93 percent of U.S. retail subscribers in 2013,350 near the end of that year there were <br />almost 900 app developers that each served more than one million active users globally.351  And app <br />developers as a group may be quite a bit smaller than broadband providers; one estimate in 2013 <br />calculated that 65 percent of app developers garner less than $35,000 per year.352   Moreover, individuals <br />are themselves quite capable of serving as edge providers, for example aspiring musicians who upload <br />videos to sites such as YouTube.353  <br />
171.<br />
How can a dispute resolution system be best structured to account for individuals and <br />
small businesses that may not have the same legal resources and effective access to the Commission as <br />broadband providers?  We propose to create an ombudsperson whose duty will be to act as a watchdog to <br />protect and promote the interests of edge providers, especially smaller entities.  Should initial pleading or <br />procedural requirements be adopted that make access to Commission processes by individuals or small <br />businesses less cumbersome?  <br />

<b>3.</b><br />
<p><b>Complaint Processes, Enforcement, and Additional Forms of Dispute <br />Resolution</b></p>
172.<br />
<i>Complaint Processes. </i>We tentatively conclude that the same three means by which the <br />
Commission focused on potential open Internet violations after the adoption of the <i>Open Internet Order</i>, <br />namely self-initiated investigation, informal complaints, and formal complaints, should be used as well to <br />enforce any new open Internet rules.  We seek comment on this tentative conclusion. Are there ways we <br />can improve our informal complaint process to make it easier to access and more effective, especially for <br />consumers and small businesses with limited resources?  For example, should the <br />Commission create a separate <i>Open Internet </i>complaint category for consumers filing informal complaints <br />under the open Internet rules? Should the Commission permit individuals to report possible <br />noncompliance with our Open Internet rules anonymously or take other steps to protect the identity of <br />individuals who may be concerned about retaliation for raising concerns?  <br />
173.<br />
<i>Enforcement.  </i>We tentatively conclude that enforcement of the transparency rule and any <br />
enhanced transparency rule that is adopted in this proceeding should proceed under the same dispute <br />mechanisms that will apply to the proposed no-blocking rule and the legal standard for provider practices <br />ultimately adopted by the Commission.  We also tentatively conclude that violations of the rules would be <br />subject to forfeiture penalties, as appropriate, under the Act.  We seek comment on these tentative <br />conclusions. <br />
174.<br />
<i>Additional Forms of Dispute Resolution</i>—<i>Alternative Dispute Resolution.  </i>In addition to <br />
the Commission processes noted above to provide guidance, flexibility, and access, we seek comment on <br />whether additional dispute resolutions should be adopted.<i>  </i>Should we adopt measures to require or <br />encourage disputes over the legality of broadband provider practices to be resolved through alternative <br />dispute resolution processes, such as arbitration?  Would such an approach be sufficiently accessible to <br />smaller edge providers, or would a different dispute resolution process be more appropriate?  Are there <br />any legal considerations, limitations, or concerns that the Commission should consider with adopting an <br />alternative dispute resolution procedure, including arbitration or mediation by a third party?354  We note <br />that under our informal dispute resolution procedures, Commission staff can mediate disputes if parties <br />voluntarily request such a process.  During such mediations, for instance, the staff may ask parties to <br />submit their best offers to facilitate negotiations.  We also can adopt specific rules to determine <br />appropriate remedies and rapid resolution of formal complaints, including a requirement that parties <br />provide their best and final offers to help Commission staff determine an appropriate remedy if a violation <br />of the rule is found.355  We seek comment on the benefits and costs of such an approach in this context.  <br />
175.<br />
<i>Additional Forms of Dispute Resolution</i>—<i>Multistakeholder Processes.  </i>We also seek <br />
comment on whether a multistakeholder approach to the enforcement of our proposed open Internet rules <br />would work in this context, in whole or in part.  For example, should the Commission provide an initial <br />forum for discussion and thereafter encourage stakeholders, should they so choose, to independently <br />develop standards that they consider to meet the governing legal standards?  Such standards might then be <br />shared with the Commission for consideration, or the stakeholders might publicize their proposed <br />standards and encourage industry to use them as best practices.  If the Commission employed a model <br />similar to that of NTIA’s multistakeholder privacy process, are there lessons we can learn from that <br />                                                     <br />
354 For example, under the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, an agency “may not require any person to consent to <br />arbitration as a condition of entering into a contract or obtaining a benefit.”  5 U.S.C. § 575(a)(3).  We note, <br />however, that this restriction does not prevent the Commission from requiring parties to submit to third-party <br />arbitration so long as the arbitration is subject to <i>de novo </i>review by the Commission. <i>See, e</i>.<i>g</i>., <i>Comcast Corp</i>.,<br /><i>Petition for Declaratory Ruling that The America Channel is not a Regional Sports Network</i>, File No. CSR-7108, <br />Order, 22 FCC Rcd 17938, 17948, para. 4, n.13 (2007).<br />355 In the <i>Data Roaming Order</i>, the Commission reserved the right to require both parties to provide their best and <br />final offers to help Commission staff determine an appropriate remedy if a violation of the rule was found.  <i>Data <br />Roaming Order</i>, 26 FCC Rcd 5411, 5450-51, paras. 79, 83.<br />

experience?356  How can a multistakeholder process best further the goals of providing guidance, <br />flexibility, and access?  <br />
176.<br />
<i>Additional Forms of Dispute Resolution</i>—<i>Technical Advisory Groups</i>.  We also seek <br />
comment on whether and how the Commission should incorporate the expertise of technical advisory <br />groups into a new open Internet framework in a manner that could serve the goals of providing guidance, <br />flexibility and access.  For example, should we invite the Open Internet Advisory Committee (OIAC), the <br />Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group (BITAG), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), or <br />the North American Network Operators Group (NANOG) to recommend to the Commission or public <br />more generally industry best practices or other codes of conduct that would either serve as presumptive <br />safe harbors and/or help determine whether a broadband provider is in compliance with our open Internet <br />rules?357  Or, rather than asking industry groups and other interested parties to play a role <i>ex ante</i>, should <br />the Commission instead ask them generally, or specific groups in particular, to weigh in on specific <br />disputes once they are brought to the Commission’s attention?358  We seek comment generally on how the <br />inclusion of advisory groups might strengthen the open Internet framework and reduce the burdens of <br />compliance.  Similarly, we seek comment on the potential value of allowing providers to opt into <br />voluntary codes of conduct or other suggested best practices that may serve as presumptive safe harbors.   <br />

<p><b>PROCEDURAL MATTERS</b></p>
<p><b>A.</b></p>
<p><b>Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis</b></p>
177.<br />
This document contains proposed new information collection requirements.  The <br />
Commission, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork burdens, invites the general public and <br />the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to comment on the information collection requirements <br />contained in this document, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13.  <br />In addition, pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198, <i>see<br /></i>44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(4), we seek specific comment on how we might further reduce the information <br />collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 25 employees.<br />
<p><b>B.</b></p>
<p><b>Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</b></p>
178.<br />
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA),359 the Commission has <br />
prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) for this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, of the <br />possible significant economic impact on small entities of the policies and rules addressed in this <br />document.  The IRFA is set forth in Appendix B.  Written public comments are requested on this IRFA. <br />Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines for comments <br />
                                                     <br />
356 For example, the Department of Commerce directed the NTIA to convene multistakeholder processes to develop <br />legally enforceable codes of conduct specifying how consumer data privacy rules should apply in specific business <br />contexts.  NTIA’s role in the privacy multistakeholder process is to “help the parties reach clarity on what their <br />positions are and whether there are options for compromise toward consensus, rather than substituting [the NTIA’s] <br />own judgment.”  The White House, <i>Consumer Data Privacy in a Networked World: A Framework for Protecting <br />Privacy and Promoting Innovation in the Global Digital Economy </i>23-26, 27 (Feb. 2012), <br /><a title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/privacy-final.pdf" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/privacy-final.pdf">http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/privacy-final.pdf</a>.    <br />357 <i>Open Internet Order</i>, 25 FCC Rcd at 17989, para. 162.  The Open Internet Advisory Committee is an inclusive <br />and transparent body comprised of a balanced group including consumer advocates; Internet engineering experts; <br />content, application, and service providers; network equipment and end-user-device manufacturers and suppliers; <br />investors; broadband service providers; and other parties the Commission may deem appropriate.  The Committee <br />aids the Commission in tracking developments with respect to the freedom and openness of the Internet, including <br />technical standards and issues relating to mobile broadband and specialized services.

AUTHORITY: 47 U.S.C. §§ 151, 152, 154(i)-(j), 303, 316, 1302<br />
<b>§ 8.1</b><br />
<p><b>Purpose.</b></p>
The purpose of this Part is to protect and promote the Internet as an open platform enabling consumer <br />choice, freedom of expression, end-user control, competition, and the freedom to innovate without <br />permission, and thereby to encourage the deployment of advanced telecommunications capability and <br />remove barriers to infrastructure investment.<br />
<b>§ 8.3</b><br />
<p><b>Transparency.</b></p>
(a)  A person engaged in the provision of broadband Internet access service shall publicly disclose <br />accurate information regarding the network management practices, performance, and commercial terms <br />of its broadband Internet access services, in a manner tailored (i) for end users to make informed choices <br />regarding use of such services, (ii) for edge providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings, <br />and (iii) for the Commission and members of the public to understand how such person complies with the <br />requirements described in sections 8.5 and 8.7 of this chapter.  <br />
(b)  In making the disclosures required by this section, a person engaged in the provision of broadband <br />Internet access service shall include meaningful information regarding the source, timing, speed, packet <br />loss, and duration of congestion.  <br />
(c) In making the disclosures required by this section, a person engaged in the provision of broadband <br />Internet access service shall publicly disclose in a timely manner to end users, edge providers, and the <br />Commission when they make changes to their network practices as well as any instances of blocking, <br />throttling, and pay-for-priority arrangements, or the parameters of default or “best effort” service as <br />distinct from any priority service.<br />
<b>§ 8.5</b><br />
<p><b>No Blocking.</b></p>
A person engaged in the provision of fixed broadband Internet access service, insofar as such person is so <br />engaged, shall not block lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices, subject to <br />reasonable network management.<br />
A person engaged in the provision of mobile broadband Internet access service, insofar as such person is <br />so engaged, shall not block consumers from accessing lawful websites, subject to reasonable network <br />

management; nor shall such person block applications that compete with the provider’s voice or video <br />telephony services, subject to reasonable network management.<br />
<b>§ 8.7</b><br />
<p><b>No Commercially Unreasonable Practices.</b></p>
A person engaged in the provision of fixed broadband Internet access service, insofar as such person is so <br />engaged, shall not engage in commercially unreasonable practices. Reasonable network management <br />shall not constitute a commercially unreasonable practice.<br />
<b>§ 8.9</b><br />
<p><b>Other Laws and Considerations.</b></p>
Nothing in this part supersedes any obligation or authorization a provider of broadband Internet access <br />service may have to address the needs of emergency communications or law enforcement, public safety, <br />or national security authorities, consistent with or as permitted by applicable law, or limits the provider’s <br />ability to do so.  <br />
Nothing in this part prohibits reasonable efforts by a provider of broadband Internet access service to <br />address copyright infringement or other unlawful activity.<br />
<b>§ 8.11 Definitions.</b><br />
(a) Block.  The failure of a broadband Internet access service to provide an edge provider with a <br />minimum level of access that is sufficiently robust, fast, and dynamic for effective use by end users and <br />edge providers.<br />
(b) Broadband Internet access service.  A mass-market retail service by wire or radio that provides the <br />capability to transmit data to and receive data from all or substantially all Internet endpoints, including <br />any capabilities that are incidental to and enable the operation of the communications service, but <br />excluding dial-up Internet access service.  This term also encompasses any service that the Commission <br />finds to be providing a functional equivalent of the service described in the previous sentence, or that is <br />used to evade the protections set forth in this Part.<br />
(c) Edge Provider.  Any individual or entity that provides any content, application, or service over the <br />Internet, and any individual or entity that provides a device used for accessing any content, application, or <br />service over the Internet.  <br />
(d) End User.  Any individual or entity that uses a broadband Internet access service.<br />
(e) Fixed broadband Internet access service.  A broadband Internet access service that serves end users <br />primarily at fixed endpoints using stationary equipment.  Fixed broadband Internet access service includes <br />fixed wireless services (including fixed unlicensed wireless services), and fixed satellite services.<br />
(f) Mobile broadband Internet access service.  A broadband Internet access service that serves end users <br />primarily using mobile stations.<br />
(g) Reasonable network management.  A network management practice is reasonable if it is appropriate <br />and tailored to achieving a legitimate network management purpose, taking into account the particular <br />network architecture and technology of the broadband Internet access service.<br />

<p><b>APPENDIX B</b></p>
<p><b>Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</b></p>
1.<br />
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),1 the <br />
Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the possible significant <br />economic impact on a substantial number of small entities from the policies and rules proposed in this <br />Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice).  The Commission requests written public comment on this <br />IRFA.  Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines for<br />comments on the Notice provided on the first page of the Notice.  The Commission will send a copy of <br />the Notice, including this IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration <br />(SBA).2  In addition, the Notice and IRFA (or summaries thereof) will be published in the Federal <br />Register.3<br />
<p><b>A.</b></p>
<p><b>Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules</b></p>
2.<br />
With this Notice, the Commission is directly responding to the remand by the U.S. Court <br />
of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in <i>Verizon v. FCC </i>of portions of the Commission’s 2010 <i>Open Internet <br />Order </i>and proposing enforceable rules to protect and promote the open Internet.4  The Notice seeks <br />comment on a variety of issues relating to the Commission’s stated objective of protecting and promoting <br />an open Internet.  The Internet’s openness promotes innovation, investment, competition, free expression <br />and other national broadband goals.  It is also critical to the Internet’s ability to serve as a platform for <br />speech and civic engagement and can help close the digital divide by facilitating the development of <br />diverse content, applications, and services.  The Commission has specifically found that the Internet’s <br />openness enables a “virtuous circle of innovation in which new uses of the network—including new <br />content, applications, services, and devices—lead to increased end-user demand for broadband, which <br />drives network improvements, which in turn lead to further innovative network uses.”5  However, as the <br />Commission has previously found, broadband providers have both the incentive and ability to limit <br />Internet openness.  As discussed in the Notice, the Commission is seeking comment on proposed open <br />Internet rules that will protect against the harms identified in the 2010 <i>Open Internet Order</i>, while <br />fostering all sources of innovation on the collection of networks known as the Internet.6  The Notice asks <br />for comment in a variety of specific areas and sets forth proposals in the following six key areas:  scope of <br />the proposed rules, enhancement of the existing transparency rule, a no-blocking rule, an enforceable rule <br />designed to protect the open Internet that is not <i>per se </i>common carriage, the best source of legal authority <br />for protection of Internet openness and an enforcement and dispute resolution process.<br />
3.<br />
First, the Notice proposes to retain the same definitions and scope as the 2010 rules.  The <br />
Notice seeks comment, however, on whether the Commission should change the scope of the proposed <br />rules as applied to the following: specifically identified services, enterprise services, Internet traffic <br />exchange, specialized services, and mobile services.  The Notice also proposes to interpret “reasonable <br />network management” under the same framework adopted in the 2010 <i>Open Internet Order </i>and seeks <br />comment on developing the scope of “reasonable network management” on a case-by-case basis under <br />the proposed rules.  <br />                                                     <br />
1 <i>See </i>5 U.S.C. § 603.  The RFA, <i>see </i>5 U.S.C. §§ 601-12, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory <br />Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).<br />2 <i>See </i>5 U.S.C. § 603(a).<br />3 <i>Id.<br /></i>4 <i>See </i>Notice Section III; <i>Verizon v. FCC</i>, 740 F.3d 623 (D.C.

Second, the Notice proposes enhancements to the Commission’s existing transparency <br />
rule, which was upheld by the D.C. Circuit.  The Notice seeks comment on whether disclosures of <br />broadband providers’ network management practices, performance, and terms and conditions that are <br />specifically tailored to the needs of affected parties would better ensure that consumers, edge providers, <br />and the Internet community at large have the information they need to understand the services they are <br />receiving and to monitor practices that could undermine the open Internet than the existing rule  The <br />Notice seeks comment on the burdens of enhanced transparency on broadband providers and specifically <br />asks if there are ways to minimize these potential costs and burdens. <br />
5.<br />
Third, the Notice proposes adopting the text of the no-blocking rule from the 2010 <i>Open </i><br />
<i>Internet Order</i>, with a revised rationale, in order to ensure that all end users and edge providers can enjoy <br />the use of robust, fast and dynamic Internet access.  To address the ongoing concerns with the harmful <br />effects that blocking of Internet traffic would have on Internet openness and to competition in adjacent <br />markets, the Notice seeks comment on a draft no-blocking rule that would allow individualized <br />bargaining above a minimum level of access to a broadband provider’s subscribers, which the D.C. <br />Circuit suggested would be permissible and take the rule out of the realm of common carriage regulation.  <br />The Notice proposes a variety of ways to establish a minimum level of access under the proposed no-<br />blocking rule and seeks comment on those interpretations.  Alternatively, the Notice seeks comment on <br />whether the Commission should adopt a no-blocking rule that either itself prohibits broadband providers <br />from entering into priority agreements with edge providers or acts in combination with a separate rule <br />prohibiting such conduct.  Additionally, consistent with the 2010 <i>Open Internet Order</i>, the Notice <br />proposes to apply the proposed no-blocking rule differently to mobile broadband providers than to fixed <br />broadband providers and seeks comment on that approach. <br />
6.<br />
Fourth, where conduct would otherwise be permissible under the no-blocking rule, the <br />
Notice proposes a separate rule that requires broadband providers to adhere to an enforceable legal <br />standard of commercially reasonable practices.  The Notice tentatively concludes that the Commission <br />should adopt a revised rule that, consistent with the court’s decision, may permit broadband providers to <br />engage in individualized practices, while prohibiting those broadband provider practices that threaten to <br />harm Internet openness.  The Commission’s proposed approach contains three essential elements: (1) an <br />enforceable legal standard of conduct barring broadband provider practices that threaten to undermine <br />Internet openness, providing certainty to network providers, end users, and edge providers alike, (2) <br />clearly established factors that give additional guidance on the kind of conduct that is likely to violate the <br />enforceable legal standard, and (3) encouragement of individualized negotiation and, if necessary, a <br />mechanism to allow the Commission to evaluate challenged practices on a case-by-case basis, thereby <br />providing flexibility in assessing whether a particular practice comports with the legal standard.  The <br />Notice proposes that the concept of reasonable network management would be treated separately from the <br />application of the commercially reasonable practices legal standard and seeks comment on this approach.  <br />The Notice asks how harm can best be identified and prohibited and whether certain practices, like paid <br />prioritization, should be barred altogether.  The Notice also seeks comment on whether the Commission <br />should consider current technical characteristics, industry practices, and the impact on consumers, among <br />other factors, when evaluating commercially reasonable practices.   <br />
7.<br />
Fifth, the Notice proposes to rely on section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 <br />
as the source of authority for the proposed rules.  It seeks comment, however, on the best source of <br />authority for protecting Internet openness, whether section 706, Title II of the Communications Act of <br />1934, as amended, and/or other sources of legal authority such as Title III of the Communications Act for <br />wireless services.  With respect to the prospect of proceeding under Title II, the Notice seeks comment on <br />whether and how the Commission should exercise its authority under section 10 of the Act—or section <br />332(c)(1) for mobile services—to forbear from specific Title II obligations that would flow from the <br />classification of a service as telecommunications service. <br />
8.<br />
Sixth, the Notice proposes a multi-faceted dispute resolution process to provide effective <br />
access for end users, edge providers, and broadband network providers alike and the creation of an <br />ombudsperson to act as a watchdog to represent the interests of consumers, start-ups and small <br />
69<br />

<A name=70></a><p><b>Federal Communications Commission</b></p>
<p><b>FCC 14-61</b></p>
businesses.  The Notice seeks comment on the level of flexibility needed for such approaches and, <br />specifically, how the Commission can ensure that the process is accessible by end users and edge <br />providers, including small entities.  The Notice also proposes that should the Commission ultimately <br />adopt one of the proposed dispute mechanisms, then enforcement of the existing transparency rule and <br />any enhancements to that rule would proceed under the same manner as enforcement of the <br />Commission’s other proposed open Internet rules if adopted. <br />
<p><b>B.</b></p>
<p><b>Legal Basis</b></p>
9.<br />
The legal basis for any action that may be taken pursuant to the Notice is contained in <br />
sections 1, 2, 4(i)-(j), 303, and 316, of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and section 706 of <br />the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 151, 152, 154(i)-(j), 303, 316, 1302,<br />
<p><b>C.</b></p>
<p><b>Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Rules <br />Would Apply</b></p>
10.<br />
The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of, and where feasible, an estimate of <br />
the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.7  The RFA generally <br />defines the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small <br />organization,” and “small governmental jurisdiction.”8  In addition, the term “small business” has the <br />same meaning as the term “small-business concern” under the Small Business Act.9  A small-business <br />concern” is one which:  (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of <br />operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.10<br />
<b>1.</b><br />
<p><b>Total Small Entities </b></p>
11.<br />
Our proposed action, if implemented, may, over time, affect small entities that are not <br />
easily categorized at present.  We therefore describe here, at the outset, three comprehensive, statutory <br />small entity size standards.11  First, nationwide, there are a total of approximately 28.2 million small <br />businesses, according to the SBA.12   In addition, a “small organization” is generally “any not-for-profit <br />enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.”13  Nationwide, as <br />of 2007, there were approximately 1,621,315 small organizations.14   Finally, the term “small <br />governmental jurisdiction” is defined generally as “governments of cities, towns, townships, villages, <br />school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.”15  Census Bureau data <br />for 2007 indicate that there were 89,476 local governmental jurisdictions in the United States.16  We <br />                                                     <br />

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 601(3), the statutory definition of a small business applies “unless an <br />agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity <br />for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the <br />agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal Register.”<br />10 <i>See </i>15 U.S.C. § 632.<br />11 <i>See </i>5 U.S.C. §§ 601(3)-(6).<br />12 <i>See </i>SBA, Office of Advocacy, “Frequently Asked Questions,” <br /><a title="http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/FAQ_March_2014_0.pdf" href="http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/FAQ_March_2014_0.pdf">http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/FAQ_March_2014_0.pdf</a> (last accessed Apr. 28, 2014).<br />13 5 U.S.C. § 601(4).<br />14 Indep.

estimate that, of this total, as many as 88,761 entities may qualify as “small governmental jurisdictions.”17  <br />Thus, we estimate that most governmental jurisdictions are small.<br />
<b>2.</b><br />
<p><b>Internet Access Service Providers</b></p>
12.<br />
The actions proposed in the Notice would apply to broadband Internet access service <br />
providers.  The 2011 Economic Census places these firms, whose services might include Voice over <br />Internet Protocol (VoIP), in either of two categories, depending on whether the service is provided over <br />the provider’s own telecommunications facilities (e.g., cable and DSL ISPs), or over client-supplied <br />telecommunications connections (e.g., dial-up ISPs).  The former are within the category of Wired <br />Telecommunications Carriers,18 which has an SBA small business size standard of 1,500 or fewer <br />employees.19  These are also labeled “broadband.”  The latter are within the category of All Other <br />Telecommunications,20 which has a size standard of annual receipts of $25 million or less.21  These are <br />labeled non-broadband.  The most current Economic Census data for Wired Telecommunications Carriers <br />are 2011 data, and the most current Economic Census data for All Other Telecommunications are 2007 <br />data, which are detailed specifically for ISPs within the categories above.  For the first category, the data <br />show that 3,372 firms operated for the entire year, of which 2,037 had nine or fewer employees.22  For the <br />second category, the data show that 1,274 firms operated for the entire year.  23 Of those, 1,252 had annual <br />receipts below $25 million per year.  Consequently, we estimate that the majority of ISP firms are small <br />entities.<br />
13.<br />
The ISP industry has changed since these definitions were introduced in 2007.  The data <br />
cited above may therefore include entities that no longer provide Internet access service and may exclude <br />entities that now provide such service.  To ensure that this IRFA describes the universe of small entities <br />that our action might affect, we discuss in turn several different types of entities that might be providing <br />Internet access service.  We note that, although we have no specific information on the number of small <br />entities that provide broadband Internet access service over unlicensed spectrum, we include these entities <br />in our Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.<br />
                                                     <br />
17 The 2007 U.S. Census data for small governmental organizations are not presented based on the size of the <br />population in each such organization. There were 89,476 local governmental organizations in 2007. If we assume<br />that county, municipal, township, and school district organizations are more likely than larger governmental <br />organizations to have populations of 50,000 or less, the total of these organizations is 52,095.  As a basis of <br />estimating how many of these 89,476 local government organizations were small, in 2011, we note that there were a <br />total of 715 cities and towns (incorporated places and minor civil divisions) with populations over 50,000.  City and <br />Town Totals Vintage: 2011 – U.S. Census Bureau, <a title="http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2011/index.html" href="http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2011/index.html">http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2011/index.html</a>.  <br />If we subtract the 715 cities and towns that meet or exceed the 50,000 population threshold, we conclude that <br />approximately 88,761 are small.

<i>Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers </i>(<i>Incumbent LECs</i>).  Neither the Commission nor the <br />
SBA has developed a small business size standard specifically for incumbent local exchange services.  <br />The appropriate size standard under SBA rules is for the category Wired Telecommunications Carriers.  <br />Under that size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.24  According to <br />Commission data,25 1,307 carriers reported that they were incumbent local exchange service providers.26  <br />Of these 1,307 carriers, an estimated 1,006 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 301 have more than 1,500 <br />employees.27   Consequently, the Commission estimates that most providers of incumbent local exchange <br />service are small businesses that may be affected by our proposed action.<br />
15.<br />
<i>Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (Competitive LECs)</i>, <i>Competitive Access Providers </i><br />
<i>(CAPs)</i>, <i>Shared-Tenant Service Providers</i>, <i>and Other Local Service Providers.</i>  Neither the Commission <br />nor the SBA has developed a small business size standard specifically for these service providers.  The <br />appropriate size standard under SBA rules is for the category Wired Telecommunications Carriers.  Under <br />that size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.28  According to <br />Commission data, 1,442 carriers reported that they were engaged in the provision of either competitive <br />local exchange services or competitive access provider services.29  Of these 1,442 carriers, an estimated <br />1,256 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 186 have more than 1,500 employees.30  In addition, 17 carriers <br />have reported that they are Shared-Tenant Service Providers, and all 17 are estimated to have 1,500 or <br />fewer employees.31  In addition, 72 carriers have reported that they are Other Local Service Providers.32  <br />Of the 72, seventy have 1,500 or fewer employees and two have more than 1,500 employees.33  <br />Consequently, the Commission estimates that most providers of competitive local exchange service, <br />competitive access providers, Shared-Tenant Service Providers, and other local service providers are <br />small entities that may be affected by our proposed action.<br />
16.<br />
We have included small incumbent LECs in this present RFA analysis.  As noted above, <br />
a “small business” under the RFA is one that, <i>inter alia</i>, meets the pertinent small business size standard <br />(e.g., a telephone communications business having 1,500 or fewer employees), and “is not dominant in its <br />field of operation.”34  The SBA’s Office of Advocacy contends that, for RFA purposes, small incumbent <br />LECs are not dominant in their field of operation because any such dominance is not “national” in <br />scope.35  We have therefore included small incumbent LECs in this RFA analysis, although we emphasize <br />

<i>Interexchange Carriers.  </i>Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a small <br />
business size standard specifically for providers of interexchange services.  The appropriate size standard <br />under SBA rules is for the category Wired Telecommunications Carriers.  Under that size standard, such a <br />business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.36  According to Commission data,37 359 carriers have <br />reported that they are engaged in the provision of interexchange service.  Of these, an estimated 317 have <br />1,500 or fewer employees and 42 have more than 1,500 employees.  Consequently, the Commission <br />estimates that the majority of IXCs are small entities that may be affected by our proposed action.<br />

<i>Operator Service Providers </i>(<i>OSPs</i>).  Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed <br />

Under that size standard, such a <br />business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.38  According to Commission data, 33 carriers have <br />reported that they are engaged in the provision of operator services.  Of these, an estimated 31 have 1,500 <br />or fewer employees and two have more than 1,500 employees.39  Consequently, the Commission <br />estimates that the majority of OSPs are small entities that may be affected by our proposed action.<br />

<p><b>Wireless Providers – Fixed and Mobile</b></p>
19.<br />
The broadband Internet access service provider category covered by this Notice may <br />
cover multiple wireless firms and categories of regulated wireless services.  Thus, to the extent the <br />wireless services listed below are used by wireless firms for broadband Internet access services, the <br />proposed actions may have an impact on those small businesses as set forth above and further below.  In <br />addition, for those services subject to auctions, we note that, as a general matter, the number of winning <br />bidders that claim to qualify as small businesses at the close of an auction does not necessarily represent <br />the number of small businesses currently in service.  Also, the Commission does not generally track <br />subsequent business size unless, in the context of assignments and transfers or reportable eligibility <br />events, unjust enrichment issues are implicated.<br />
20.<br />
<i>Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite</i>).  Since 2007, the Census Bureau <br />
has placed wireless firms within this new, broad, economic census category.40  Prior to 2007, such firms <br />were within the now-superseded categories of “Paging” and “Cellular and Other Wireless <br />Telecommunications.”41  Under the present and prior categories, the SBA has deemed a wireless business <br />to be small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.42  For the category of Wireless Telecommunications <br />

Carriers (except Satellite), data for 2011 show that there were 784 firms operating that year.43  Of these <br />784 firms, an estimated 749 have 500 or fewer employees and 35 have more than 500 employees.  Since <br />all firms with fewer than 1,500 employees are considered small, given the total employment in the sector, <br />we estimate that the vast majority of wireless firms are small.<br />
21.<br />
<i>Wireless Communications Services</i>.  This service can be used for fixed, mobile, <br />
radiolocation, and digital audio broadcasting satellite uses.  The Commission defined “small business” for <br />the wireless communications services (WCS) auction as an entity with average gross revenues of $40 <br />million for each of the three preceding years, and a “very small business” as an entity with average gross <br />revenues of $15 million for each of the three preceding years.44  The SBA has approved these <br />definitions.45  The Commission auctioned geographic area licenses in the WCS service in 1997.  In the <br />auction, seven bidders won 31 licenses that qualified as very small business entities, and one bidder won <br />one license that qualified as a small business entity.<br />
22.<br />
<i>1670–1675 MHz Services</i>.  This service can be used for fixed and mobile uses, except <br />
aeronautical mobile.46  An auction for one license in the 1670–1675 MHz band was conducted in 2003.  <br />One license was awarded.  The winning bidder was not a small entity.<br />
23.<br />
<i>Wireless Telephony</i>.  Wireless telephony includes cellular, personal communications <br />
services, and specialized mobile radio telephony carriers.  As noted, the SBA has developed a small <br />business size standard for Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).47  Under the SBA <br />small business size standard, a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.48 According to <br />Commission data, 413 carriers reported that they were engaged in wireless telephony.49  Of these, an <br />estimated 261 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 152 have more than 1,500 employees.50  Therefore, a <br />little less than one third of these entities can be considered small.<br />
24.<br />
<i>Broadband Personal Communications Service.</i>  The broadband personal communications <br />
services (PCS) spectrum is divided into six frequency blocks designated A through F, and the <br />Commission has held auctions for each block.  The Commission initially defined a “small business” for <br />C- and F-Block licenses as an entity that has average gross revenues of $40 million or less in the three <br />previous calendar years.51  For F-Block licenses, an additional small business size standard for “very <br />small business” was added and is defined as an entity that, together with its affiliates, has average gross <br />

revenues of not more than $15 million for the preceding three calendar years.52  These small business size <br />standards, in the context of broadband PCS auctions, have been approved by the SBA.53  No small <br />businesses within the SBA-approved small business size standards bid successfully for licenses in Blocks <br />A and B.  There were 90 winning bidders that claimed small business status in the first two C-Block<br />auctions.  A total of 93 bidders that claimed small business status won approximately 40 percent of the <br />1,479 licenses in the first auction for the D, E, and F Blocks.54  On April 15, 1999, the Commission <br />completed the reauction of 347 C-, D-, E-, and F-Block licenses in Auction No. 22.55  Of the 57 winning <br />bidders in that auction, 48 claimed small business status and won 277 licenses.<br />
25.<br />
On January 26, 2001, the Commission completed the auction of 422 C and F Block <br />
Broadband PCS licenses in Auction No. 35.  Of the 35 winning bidders in that auction, 29 claimed small <br />business status.56  Subsequent events concerning Auction 35, including judicial and agency <br />determinations, resulted in a total of 163 C and F Block licenses being available for grant.  On February <br />15, 2005, the Commission completed an auction of 242 C-, D-, E-, and F-Block licenses in Auction No. <br />58.  Of the 24 winning bidders in that auction, 16 claimed small business status and won 156 licenses.57  <br />On May 21, 2007, the Commission completed an auction of 33 licenses in the A, C, and F Blocks in <br />Auction No. 71.58  Of the 12 winning bidders in that auction, five claimed small business status and won <br />18 licenses.59  On August 20, 2008, the Commission completed the auction of 20 C-, D-, E-, and F-Block <br />Broadband PCS licenses in Auction No. 78.60  Of the eight winning bidders for Broadband PCS licenses <br />in that auction, six claimed small business status and won 14 licenses.61<br />

<i>Specialized Mobile Radio Licenses.</i>  The Commission awards “small entity” bidding <br />
credits in auctions for Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) geographic area licenses in the 800 MHz and 900 <br />MHz bands to firms that had revenues of no more than $15 million in each of the three previous calendar <br />years.62  The Commission awards “very small entity” bidding credits to firms that had revenues of no <br />more than $3 million in each of the three previous calendar years.63  The SBA has approved these small <br />

business size standards for the 900 MHz Service.64  The Commission has held auctions for geographic <br />area licenses in the 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands.  The 900 MHz SMR auction began on December 5, <br />1995, and closed on April 15, 1996.  Sixty bidders claiming that they qualified as small businesses under <br />the $15 million size standard won 263 geographic area licenses in the 900 MHz SMR band.  The 800 <br />MHz SMR auction for the upper 200 channels began on October 28, 1997, and was completed on <br />December 8, 1997.  Ten bidders claiming that they qualified as small businesses under the $15 million <br />size standard won 38 geographic area licenses for the upper 200 channels in the 800 MHz SMR band.65  A <br />second auction for the 800 MHz band was held on January 10, 2002 and closed on January 17, 2002 and <br />included 23 BEA licenses.  One bidder claiming small business status won five licenses.66<br />
27.<br />
The auction of the 1,053 800 MHz SMR geographic area licenses for the General <br />
Category channels began on August 16, 2000, and was completed on September 1, 2000.  Eleven bidders <br />won 108 geographic area licenses for the General Category channels in the 800 MHz SMR band and <br />qualified as small businesses under the $15 million size standard.67  In an auction completed on December <br />5, 2000, a total of 2,800 Economic Area licenses in the lower 80 channels of the 800 MHz SMR service <br />were awarded.68  Of the 22 winning bidders, 19 claimed small business status and won 129 licenses.  <br />Thus, combining all four auctions, 41 winning bidders for geographic licenses in the 800 MHz SMR band <br />claimed status as small businesses.<br />
28.<br />
In addition, there are numerous incumbent site-by-site SMR licenses and licensees with <br />
extended implementation authorizations in the 800 and 900 MHz bands.  We do not know how many <br />firms provide 800 MHz or 900 MHz geographic area SMR service pursuant to extended implementation <br />authorizations, nor how many of these providers have annual revenues of no more than $15 million.  One <br />firm has over $15 million in revenues.  In addition, we do not know how many of these firms have 1,500 <br />or fewer employees, which is the SBA-determined size standard.69  We assume, for purposes of this <br />analysis, that all of the remaining extended implementation authorizations are held by small entities, as <br />defined by the SBA.<br />
29.<br />
<i>Lower 700 MHz Band Licenses</i>.  The Commission previously adopted criteria for <br />
defining three groups of small businesses for purposes of determining their eligibility for special <br />provisions such as bidding credits.70  The Commission defined a “small business” as an entity that, <br />together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues not exceeding $40 <br />million for the preceding three years.71  A “very small business” is defined as an entity that, together with <br />its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues that are not more than $15 million for <br />the preceding three years.72  Additionally, the lower 700 MHz Service had a third category of small <br />

business status for Metropolitan/Rural Service Area (MSA/RSA) licenses—“entrepreneur”—which is <br />defined as an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues <br />that are not more than $3 million for the preceding three years.73  The SBA approved these small size <br />standards.74  An auction of 740 licenses (one license in each of the 734 MSAs/RSAs and one license in <br />each of the six Economic Area Groupings (EAGs)) commenced on August 27, 2002, and closed on <br />September 18, 2002.  Of the 740 licenses available for auction, 484 licenses were won by 102 winning <br />bidders.  Seventy-two of the winning bidders claimed small business, very small business or entrepreneur <br />status and won a total of 329 licenses.75  A second auction commenced on May 28, 2003, closed on June <br />13, 2003, and included 256 licenses:  5 EAG licenses and 476 Cellular Market Area licenses.76  Seventeen <br />winning bidders claimed small or very small business status and won 60 licenses, and nine winning <br />bidders claimed entrepreneur status and won 154 licenses.77  On July 26, 2005, the Commission <br />completed an auction of 5 licenses in the Lower 700 MHz band (Auction No. 60).  There were three <br />winning bidders for five licenses.  All three winning bidders claimed small business status.<br />
30.<br />
In 2007, the Commission reexamined its rules governing the 700 MHz band in the <i>700 </i><br />
<i>MHz Second Report and Order</i>.78  An auction of 700 MHz licenses commenced January 24, 2008 and <br />closed on March 18, 2008, which included, 176 Economic Area licenses in the A Block, 734 Cellular <br />Market Area licenses in the B Block, and 176 EA licenses in the E Block.79  Twenty winning bidders, <br />claiming small business status (those with attributable average annual gross revenues that exceed $15 <br />million and do not exceed $40 million for the preceding three years) won 49 licenses.  Thirty three <br />winning bidders claiming very small business status (those with attributable average annual gross <br />revenues that do not exceed $15 million for the preceding three years) won 325 licenses.<br />
31.<br />
<i>Upper 700 MHz Band Licenses</i>.  In the <i>700 MHz Second Report and Order</i>, the <br />
Commission revised its rules regarding Upper 700 MHz licenses.80  On January 24, 2008, the <br />Commission commenced Auction 73 in which several licenses in the Upper 700 MHz band were <br />available for licensing:  12 Regional Economic Area Grouping licenses in the C Block, and one <br />nationwide license in the D Block.81  The auction concluded on March 18, 2008, with 3 winning bidders <br />claiming very small business status (those with attributable average annual gross revenues that do not <br />exceed $15 million for the preceding three years) and winning five licenses.<br />

<i>700 MHz Guard Band Licensees</i>.  In 2000, in the 700 MHz Guard Band Order, the <br />
Commission adopted size standards for “small businesses” and “very small businesses” for purposes of <br />determining their eligibility for special provisions such as bidding credits and installment payments.82  A <br />small business in this service is an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has <br />average gross revenues not exceeding $40 million for the preceding three years.83  Additionally, a very <br />small business is an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross <br />revenues that are not more than $15 million for the preceding three years.84  SBA approval of these <br />definitions is not required.85  An auction of 52 Major Economic Area licenses commenced on September <br />6, 2000, and closed on September 21, 2000.86  Of the 104 licenses auctioned, 96 licenses were sold to nine <br />bidders.  Five of these bidders were small businesses that won a total of 26 licenses.  A second auction of <br />700 MHz Guard Band licenses commenced on February 13, 2001, and closed on February 21, 2001.  All <br />eight of the licenses auctioned were sold to three bidders.  One of these bidders was a small business that <br />won a total of two licenses.87<br />
33.<br />
<i>Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service</i>.  The Commission has previously used the SBA’s <br />
small business size standard applicable to Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite), i.e., <br />an entity employing no more than 1,500 persons.88  There are approximately 100 licensees in the Air-<br />Ground Radiotelephone Service, and under that definition, we estimate that almost all of them qualify as <br />small entities under the SBA definition.  For purposes of assigning Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service <br />licenses through competitive bidding, the Commission has defined “small business” as an entity that, <br />together with controlling interests and affiliates, has average annual gross revenues for the preceding <br />three years not exceeding $40 million.89  A “very small business” is defined as an entity that, together <br />with controlling interests and affiliates, has average annual gross revenues for the preceding three years <br />not exceeding $15 million.90  These definitions were approved by the SBA.91  In May 2006, the <br />Commission completed an auction of nationwide commercial Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service <br />licenses in the 800 MHz band (Auction No. 65).  On June 2, 2006, the auction closed with two winning <br />

<i>AWS Services (1710–1755 MHz  and 2110–2155 MHz bands (AWS-1); 1915–1920 MHz</i>,<br />
<i>1995–2000 MHz</i>, <i>2020–2025 MHz and 2175–2180 MHz bands (AWS-2); 2155–2175 MHz band (AWS-<br />3))</i>.  For the AWS-1 bands,92 the Commission has defined a “small business” as an entity with average <br />annual gross revenues for the preceding three years not exceeding $40 million, and a “very small <br />business” as an entity with average annual gross revenues for the preceding three years not exceeding $15 <br />million.  For AWS-2 and AWS-3, although we do not know for certain which entities are likely to apply <br />for these frequencies, we note that the AWS-1 bands are comparable to those used for cellular service and <br />personal communications service.  The Commission has not yet adopted size standards for the AWS-2 or <br />AWS-3 bands but proposes to treat both AWS-2 and AWS-3 similarly to broadband PCS service and <br />AWS-1 service due to the comparable capital requirements and other factors, such as issues involved in <br />relocating incumbents and developing markets, technologies, and services.93<br />
35.<br />
<i>3650–3700 MHz band</i>.  In March 2005, the Commission released a <i>Report and Order </i><br />
<i>and Memorandum Opinion and Order </i>that provides for nationwide, non-exclusive licensing of terrestrial <br />operations, utilizing contention-based technologies, in the 3650 MHz band (i.e., 3650–3700 MHz).  As of <br />April 2010, more than 1270 licenses have been granted and more than 7433 sites  have been registered.  <br />The Commission has not developed a definition of small entities applicable to 3650–3700 MHz band <br />nationwide, non-exclusive licensees.  However, we estimate that the majority of these licensees are <br />Internet Access Service Providers (ISPs) and that most of those licensees are small businesses.<br />

<i>Fixed Microwave Services.</i>  Microwave services include common carrier,94 private-<br />
operational fixed,95 and broadcast auxiliary radio services.96  They also include the Local Multipoint <br />Distribution Service (LMDS),97 the Digital Electronic Message Service (DEMS),98 and the 24 GHz <br />Service,99 where licensees can choose between common carrier and non-common carrier status.100  At <br />present, there are approximately 36,708 common carrier fixed licensees and 59,291 private operational-<br />fixed licensees and broadcast auxiliary radio licensees in the microwave services.  There are <br />approximately 135 LMDS licensees, three DEMS licensees, and three 24 GHz licensees.  The <br />

Commission has not yet defined a small business with respect to microwave services.  For purposes of the <br />IRFA, we will use the SBA’s definition applicable to Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except <br />satellite)—i.e., an entity with no more than 1,500 persons.101  Under the present and prior categories, the <br />SBA has deemed a wireless business to be small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.102  For the category of <br />Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite), data for 2011 show that there were 784 firms <br />operating that year.103  While the Census Bureau has not released data on the establishments broken down <br />by number of employees, we note that the Census Bureau lists total employment for all firms in that <br />sector at 245,875.104  Since all firms with fewer than 1,500 employees are considered small, given the <br />total employment in the sector, we estimate that the vast majority of firms using microwave services are <br />small.  We note that the number of firms does not necessarily track the number of licensees.  We estimate <br />that virtually all of the Fixed Microwave licensees (excluding broadcast auxiliary licensees) would <br />qualify as small entities under the SBA definition.<br />

<i>Broadband Radio Service and Educational Broadband Service.</i>  Broadband Radio <br />
Service systems, previously referred to as Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) and Multichannel <br />Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS) systems, and “wireless cable,” transmit video programming to <br />subscribers and provide two-way high speed data operations using the microwave frequencies of the <br />Broadband Radio Service (BRS) and Educational Broadband Service (EBS) (previously referred to as the <br />Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS)).105  In connection with the 1996 BRS auction, the <br />Commission established a small business size standard as an entity that had annual average gross <br />revenues of no more than $40 million in the previous three calendar years.106  The BRS auctions resulted <br />in 67 successful bidders obtaining licensing opportunities for 493 Basic Trading Areas (BTAs).  Of the 67 <br />auction winners, 61 met the definition of a small business.  BRS also includes licensees of stations <br />authorized prior to the auction.  At this time, we estimate that of the 61 small business BRS auction <br />winners, 48 remain small business licensees.  In addition to the 48 small businesses that hold BTA <br />authorizations, there are approximately 392 incumbent BRS licensees that are considered small entities.107  <br />After adding the number of small business auction licensees to the number of incumbent licensees not <br />already counted, we find that there are currently approximately 440 BRS licensees that are defined as <br />small businesses under either the SBA or the Commission’s rules.<br />

In 2009, the Commission conducted Auction 86, the sale of 78 licenses in the BRS <br />
areas.108  The Commission offered three levels of bidding credits: (i) a bidder with attributed average <br />                                                     <br />

39.<br />
In addition, the SBA’s Cable Television Distribution Services small business size <br />
standard is applicable to EBS.  There are presently 2,436 EBS licensees.  All but 100 of these licenses are <br />held by educational institutions.  Educational institutions are included in this analysis as small entities.111  <br />Thus, we estimate that at least 2,336 licensees are small businesses.  Since 2007, Cable Television <br />Distribution Services have been defined within the broad economic census category of Wired <br />Telecommunications Carriers; that category is defined as follows:  “This industry comprises <br />establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access to transmission facilities and <br />infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using <br />wired telecommunications networks.  Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a <br />combination of technologies.”112  The SBA has developed a small business size standard for this category, <br />which is:  all such firms having 1,500 or fewer employees.  To gauge small business prevalence for these <br />cable services we must, however, use the most current census data that are based on the previous category <br />of Cable and Other Program Distribution and its associated size standard; that size standard was:  all such <br />firms having $13.5 million or less in annual receipts.113  According to Census Bureau data for 2007, there <br />were a total of 996 firms in this category that operated for the entire year.114  Of this total, 948 firms had <br />annual receipts of under $10 million, and 48 firms had receipts of $10 million or more but less than $25 <br />million.115  Thus, the majority of these firms can be considered small.<br />

The category of Satellite Telecommunications “comprises establishments primarily <br />
engaged in providing telecommunications services to other establishments in the telecommunications and <br />broadcasting industries by forwarding and receiving communications signals via a system of satellites or <br />reselling satellite telecommunications.”118  For this category, Census Bureau data for 2007 show that there <br />were a total of 570 firms that operated for the entire year.119  Of this total, 530 firms had annual receipts of <br />under $30 million, and 40 firms had receipts of over $30 million.120  Consequently, we estimate that the <br />majority of Satellite Telecommunications firms are small entities that might be affected by our action.<br />
42.<br />
The second category of Other Telecommunications comprises, <i>inter alia</i>, “establishments <br />
primarily engaged in providing specialized telecommunications services, such as satellite tracking, <br />communications telemetry, and radar station operation.  This industry also includes establishments <br />primarily engaged in providing satellite terminal stations and associated facilities connected with one or <br />more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting telecommunications to, and receiving <br />telecommunications from, satellite systems.”121  For this category, Census Bureau data for 2007 show that <br />there were a total of 1,274 firms that operated for the entire year.122  Of this total, 1,252 had annual <br />receipts below $25 million per year.123  Consequently, we estimate that the majority of All Other <br />Telecommunications firms are small entities that might be affected by our action.<br />

<p><b>Cable Service Providers</b></p>
43.<br />
Because section 706 requires us to monitor the deployment of broadband using any <br />
technology, we anticipate that some broadband service providers may not provide telephone service.  <br />Accordingly, we describe below other types of firms that may provide broadband services, including <br />cable companies, MDS providers, and utilities, among others.<br />
44.<br />
<i>Cable and Other Program Distributors</i>.  Since 2007, these services have been defined <br />
within the broad economic census category of Wired Telecommunications Carriers; that category is <br />defined as follows:  “This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or <br />providing access to transmission facilities and infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the<br />transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using wired telecommunications networks.  <br />Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a combination of technologies.”124  The <br />SBA has developed a small business size standard for this category, which is:  all such firms having 1,500 <br />or fewer employees.  To gauge small business prevalence for these cable services we must, however, use <br />current census data that are based on the previous category of Cable and Other Program Distribution and <br />its associated size standard; that size standard was:  all such firms having $13.5 million or less in annual <br />receipts.125  According to Census Bureau data for 2007, there were a total of 2,048 firms in this category <br />

that operated for the entire year.126  Of this total, 1,393 firms had annual receipts of under $10 million, and <br />655 firms had receipts of $10 million or more.127  Thus, the majority of these firms can be considered <br />small.<br />
45.<br />
<i>Cable Companies and Systems.</i>  The Commission has also developed its own small <br />
business size standards, for the purpose of cable rate regulation.  Under the Commission’s rules, a “small <br />cable company” is one serving 400,000 or fewer subscribers, nationwide.128  Industry data shows that <br />there were 1,141 cable companies at the end of June 2012.129  Of this total, all but ten cable operators <br />nationwide are small under this size standard.130 In addition, under the Commission’s rules, a “small <br />system” is a cable system serving 15,000 or fewer subscribers.131  Current Commission records show <br />4,945 cable systems nationwide.132  Of this total, 4,380 cable systems have less than 20,000 subscribers, <br />and 565 systems have 20,000 or more subscribers, based on the same records.  Thus, under this standard, <br />we estimate that most cable systems are small entities.<br />
46.<br />
<i>Cable System Operators</i>.  The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, also contains a <br />
size standard for small cable system operators, which is “a cable operator that, directly or through an <br />affiliate, serves in the aggregate fewer than 1 percent of all subscribers in the United States and is not <br />affiliated with any entity or entities whose gross annual revenues in the aggregate exceed <br />$250,000,000.”133  The Commission has determined that an operator serving fewer than 677,000 <br />subscribers shall be deemed a small operator, if its annual revenues, when combined with the total annual <br />revenues of all its affiliates, do not exceed $250 million in the aggregate.134  Based on available data, we <br />find that all but ten incumbent cable operators are small entities under this size standard.135  We note that <br />                                                     <br />

the Commission neither requests nor collects information on whether cable system operators are affiliated <br />with entities whose gross annual revenues exceed $250 million,136 and therefore we are unable to estimate <br />more accurately the number of cable system operators that would qualify as small under this size <br />standard.<br />
<b>7.</b><br />
<p><b>Electric Power Generators, Transmitters, and Distributors</b></p>
47.<br />
<i>Electric Power Generators</i>, <i>Transmitters</i>, <i>and Distributors.</i>  The Census Bureau defines <br />
an industry group comprised of “establishments, primarily engaged in generating, transmitting, and/or <br />distributing electric power.  Establishments in this industry group may perform one or more of the <br />following activities:  (1) operate generation facilities that produce electric energy; (2) operate <br />transmission systems that convey the electricity from the generation facility to the distribution system; <br />and (3) operate distribution systems that convey electric power received from the generation facility or <br />the transmission system to the final consumer.”137  The SBA has developed a small business size standard <br />for firms in this category:  “A firm is small if, including its affiliates, it is primarily engaged in the <br />generation, transmission, and/or distribution of electric energy for sale and its total electric output for the <br />preceding fiscal year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours.”138  According to Census Bureau data for <br />2011, there were 2,419 firms in this category that operated for the entire year.139  Census data do not track <br />electric output and we have not determined how many of these firms fit the SBA size standard for small, <br />with no more than 4 million megawatt hours of electric output.  Consequently, we estimate that 2,419 or <br />fewer firms may be considered small under the SBA small business size standard.<br />

<p><b>Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance<br />Requirements for Small Entities</b></p>
48.<br />
As indicated above, the Notice seeks comment on possible enhancements to the <br />
Commission’s existing transparency rule that may impose additional reporting, recordkeeping, or other <br />compliance requirements on some small entities.140  While the Notice tentatively concludes that the <br />Commission should enhance the transparency rule to improve its effectiveness for end users, edge <br />providers, the Internet community, and the Commission, the Notice does not propose specific revisions to <br />the existing transparency rule.  As described above, the Notice also seeks comment on a dispute <br />resolution process that would, if adopted, potentially require small entities to respond to complaints or <br />otherwise participate in dispute resolution procedures.141 One feature of the enforcement mechanism as <br />discussed in the Notice, includes a proposal to establish the role of an ombudsperson who would act as a <br />watchdog to represent the interests of start-ups and other small entities in addition to consumers.<br />

(1) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into <br />account the resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of <br />compliance or reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; (3) the use of performance, rather <br />than design, standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for small <br />entities.142  We expect to consider all of these factors when we have received substantive comment from <br />the public and potentially affected entities.<br />

The Commission expects to consider the economic impact on small entities, as identified <br />

We note, though, that the potential enhancements to the transparency rule, the proposed <br />
mechanism for individualized decision-making under the proposed enforceable legal standard of <br />commercially reasonable practices, and various aspects of the proposed dispute resolution process all <br />contemplate a certain amount of flexibility that may be helpful to small entities.  For example, the <br />Commission seeks comment on whether there are ways the Commission or industry associations could <br />reduce burdens on broadband providers in complying with the proposed enhanced transparency rule <br />through the use of a voluntary industry standardized glossary, or through the creation of a dashboard that <br />permits easy comparison of the policies, procedures, and prices of various broadband providers <br />throughout the country.  We seek comment here on the effect the various proposals described in the <br />Notice, and summarized above, will have on small entities, and on what effect alternative rules would <br />have on those entities.

Re:   <br />
<i>Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet</i>, GN Docket No. 14-28.<br />
I strongly support an open, fast and robust Internet.  This agency supports an Open Internet. <br />
There is ONE Internet.  Not a fast internet, not a slow internet; ONE Internet.<br />
The attention being paid to this topic is proof of why the open and free exchange of information <br />
must be protected.  Thank you to the thousands who have emailed me personally.  Thank you to those <br />who felt so strongly about the issue that they camped outside.  The Founding Fathers must be looking <br />down and smiling at how the republic they created is practicing the ideals they established.<br />
By releasing this Item today those who have been expressing themselves will now be able to see <br />
what we are actually proposing.  They have been heard, we look forward to further input, and we say <br />thank you.<br />
Today we take another step in what has been a decade-long effort to preserve and protect the <br />
Open Internet.  Unfortunately, those previous efforts were blocked twice by court challenges by those <br />who sell Internet connections to consumers.  Today this agency moves to surmount that opposition and to <br />stand up for consumers and the Open Internet.<br />
This <i>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking </i>starts an important process.  Where it ends depends on what <br />
we learn during this process.  That is why I am grateful for all the attention this topic has received.<br />
We start with the simple, obvious premise: Protecting the Open Internet is important both to <br />
consumers and to economic growth.  We are dedicated to protecting and preserving an Open Internet.<br />
What we are dealing with today is a proposal, not a final rule.  With this <i>Notice </i>we are <br />
specifically asking for input on different approaches to accomplish the same goal: an Open Internet.<br />
The potential for there to be some kind of “fast lane” available to only a few has many people <br />
concerned.  Personally, I don’t like the idea that the Internet could become divided into “haves” and <br />“have nots.”  I will work to see that does not happen.  In this Item we specifically ask whether and how to <br />prevent the kind of paid prioritization that could result in “fast lanes.”<br />
Two weeks ago I told the convention of America’s cable broadband providers something that is <br />
worth repeating here, “If someone acts to divide the Internet between ‘haves’ and ‘have nots,’”  I told the <br />cable industry, “we will use every power at our disposal to stop it.”  I will take a backseat to no one that <br />privileging some network users in a manner that squeezes out smaller voices is unacceptable.  Today, we <br />have proposed how to stop that from happening, including consideration of the applicability of Title II.<br />
There is only ONE Internet.  It must be fast, robust and open.  The speed and quality of the <br />
connection the consumer purchases must be unaffected by what content he or she is using.<br />
And there has to be a level playing field of opportunity for new ideas.  Small companies and <br />
startups must be able to effectively reach consumers with innovative products and services and they must <br />be protected against harmful conduct by broadband providers.  The prospect of a gatekeeper choosing <br />winners and losers on the Internet is unacceptable.<br />
Let’s look at how the Internet works at the retail level.  The consumer accesses the Internet using <br />
connectivity provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP).  That connectivity should be open and <br />
86<br />
<hr>
<A name=87></a><p><b>Federal Communications Commission</b></p>
<p><b>FCC 14-61</b></p>
inviolate; it is the simple purchase of a pathway.  I believe it would be commercially unreasonable – and <br />therefore not permitted– for the ISP not to deliver the contracted-for open pathway.<br />
Let’s consider specifically what that means.  I want to get to rules that work like this:<br />
 If the network operator slowed the speed below that which the consumer bought (for reasons <br />
other than reasonable network management), it would be a commercially unreasonable <br />practice and therefore <b>prohibited,</b><br />
 If the network operator blocked access to lawful content, it would violate our no blocking <br />
rule and be commercially unreasonable and therefore doubly <b>prohibited,</b><br />
 When content provided by a firm such as Netflix reaches the consumer’s network provider it <br />
would be commercially unreasonable to charge the content provider to use the bandwidth for <br />which the consumer had already paid and therefore <b>prohibited,</b><br />
 When a consumer buys specified capacity from a network provider he or she is buying open <br />
capacity, not capacity the network can prioritize for its own profit purposes.  Prioritization <br />that deprives the consumer of what the consumer has paid for would be commercially <br />unreasonable and therefore <b>prohibited.</b><br />
Simply put, when a consumer buys a specified bandwidth, it is commercially unreasonable – and <br />
thus a violation of this proposal – to deny them the full connectivity and the full benefits that connection <br />enables.<br />
Also included in this proposal are two new powers for those who use the Internet and for the <br />
Commission:<br />
 <p><b>Expanded transparency will require networks to inform on themselves: </b></p>The proposal <br />
expands the existing transparency rules to require that networks disclose any practices that <br />could change a consumer’s or a content provider’s relationship with the network.  I thus <br />anticipate that, if a network ever planned to take an action that would affect a content <br />provider’s access there would be time for the FCC to consider petitions to review such an <br />action.<br />
 <p><b>Voice for the Average American: </b></p>Recognizing that Internet entrepreneurs and consumers <br />
shouldn’t have to hire a lawyer to call the Commission’s attention to a grievance, an <br />Ombudsperson would be created within the FCC to receive their complaints and, where <br />warranted, investigate and represent their case.<br />
Separate and apart from this connectivity is the question of interconnection (“peering”) between <br />
the consumer’s network provider and the various networks that deliver to that ISP.  That is a different <br />matter that is better addressed separately.  Today’s proposal is all about what happens on the broadband <br />provider’s network and how the consumer’s connection to the Internet may not be interfered with or <br />otherwise compromised.<br />
The situation in which this Commission finds itself is inherited from the actions of previous <br />
Commissions over the last decade.  The D.C. Circuit’s ruling in January of this year upheld our <br />determination that we need rules to protect Internet openness, and upheld our authority under Section 706 <br />to adopt such rules, even while it found that portions of the <i>2010 Open Internet Order </i>were beyond the <br />scope of our authority.  In response, I promptly stated that we would reinstate rules that achieve the goals <br />of the 2010 <i>Order </i>using the Section 706-based roadmap laid out by the court.  That is what we are <br />proposing today.<br />
Section 706 is one of the two principal methods proposed to accomplish the goals of an Open <br />
Internet.  Today we are seeking input on both Section 706 and Title II of the Communications Act.  <p><b>We </b></p>
87<br />
<hr>
<A name=88></a><p><b>Federal Communications Commission</b></p>
<p><b>FCC 14-61</b></p>
<b>are specifically asking for input as to the benefits of each and why one might be preferable to <br />another.  </b>We have established a lengthy comment and reply period sufficient to allow everyone an <br />opportunity to participate.<br />
As a former entrepreneur and venture capitalist, I know the importance of openness first hand.  <br />
As an entrepreneur, I have had products and services shut out of closed cable networks.  As a VC, I <br />invested in companies that wouldn’t have been able to innovate if the Internet weren’t open.  I have <br />hands-on experience with the importance of network openness.<br />
<p><b>I will not allow the national asset of an Open Internet to be compromised</b></p>.  I understand this <br />
issue in my bones.  I can show you the scars from when my companies were denied open access in the <br />pre-Internet days.<br />
The consideration we are beginning today is not about whether the Internet must be open, but <br />
about how and when we will have rules in place to assure an Open Internet.  My preference has been to <br />follow the roadmap laid out by the D.C. Circuit in the belief that it was the fastest and best way to get <br />protections in place.  I have also indicated repeatedly that I am open to using Title II.<br />
This rulemaking begins the process by putting forth a proposal, asking important and specific <br />
questions, and opening the discussion to all Americans.  We look forward to hearing feedback on all these <br />approaches.<br />

<p><b>STATEMENT OF </b></p>
<p><b>COMMISSIONER MIGNON L. CLYBURN </b></p>
Re:   <br />
<i>Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet</i>, GN Docket No. 14-28.<br />
When my mother calls, with public policy concerns, I know there is a problem. <br />
In my 16 years as a public servant, Emily Clyburn has never called me about a substantive issue <br />
under consideration.  Not during my time serving on the South Carolina Public Service Commission.  Not <br />during my tenure here as a Commissioner nor as Acting Chairwoman.  Never.  But all of that changed on <br />Monday, April 28th.<br />
Please indulge me for a moment.  My mother is a very organized, intuitive and intelligent woman.  <br />
She was a medical librarian and earned a master’s degree while she raised three girls. She is smart, <br />thoughtful and engaged.  She is a natural researcher.  So when <b>she </b>picked up the phone to call me about <br />this issue, I knew for sure something was just not right.    <br />
She gave voice to three basic questions which, and as of today’s date, her message remains on my <br />
telephone and in personal memory banks:  (1) “what is this net neutrality issue?” (2) “can providers do <br />what they want to do?” and (3) “did it already pass?”  <br />
So, like any good daughter with an independent streak, I will directly answer my mother’s <br />
questions in my own time and in my own way.  But her inquiry truly echoes the calls, emails and letters I <br />have received from thousands of consumers, investors, startups, healthcare providers, educators and <br />others across the country who are equally concerned and confused.  All of this demonstrates, (no pun <br />intended) how fundamental the Internet has become for all of us.  <br />
<p><b>So, why are we here, and exactly what is net neutrality or Open Internet?</b></p>  First, let me start <br />
from a place where I believe most of us can agree that a free and open exchange of ideas is critical to a <br />democratic society.  Consumers with the ability to visit whatever website and access any lawful content <br />of their choice, interact with their government, apply for a job, even monitor their household devices.  <br />Educators have the capacity to leverage the best digital learning tools for their students.  Healthcare <br />providers treating their patients with the latest technologies – all of this occurring without those services <br />or content being discriminated against or blocked.  <br />
All content, all “bits,” being treated equally.  Small startups on a shoestring budget with novel <br />
ideas have the ability to reach millions of people and compete on equal footing with those established <br />players and their considerable budgets. Innovation abounds with new applications, technologies and <br />services.  <br />
At its core, an open Internet means that <b>consumers</b>, not a company, not the government, <br />
determine winners and losers.  It is the free market at its best.  All of this, however, does not nor will it <br />ever, occur organically.  Without rules governing a free and open Internet it is possible that companies –<br />fixed and wireless broadband providers – could independently determine whether they want to <br />discriminate or block content, pick favorites, charge higher fees or distort the market.  <br />
I have been listening to concerns not just from my mother, but from thousands of consumers and <br />
interested parties.  Startups that fear, they “won’t even get a chance to succeed,” if access to consumers is <br />controlled by corporations, rather than a competitive level playing field.  Investors who say they will be <br />reticent to commit money to new companies because they are concerned that their new service will not be <br />able to reach consumers in the marketplace because of high costs or differential treatment.  <br />
89<br />
<hr>
<A name=90></a><p><b>Federal Communications Commission</b></p>
<p><b>FCC 14-61</b></p>
Educators, even where there is a high capacity connection at the school, feel that their students <br />
may not be able to take advantage of the best in digital learning if the quality of the content is poor. <br />Healthcare professionals worrying that the images they need to view will load too slowly and that patients <br />will be unable to benefit from the latest technologies and specialized care made possible through remote <br />monitoring.  And, I am hearing from everyday people, who say that we need to maintain the openness of <br />the Internet and that this openness enables today’s discourse to be viewed by thousands, and offers them <br />the ability to interact directly with policy makers and engage in robust exchanges like we are experiencing <br />today.  <br />
In fact, let me say how impressed I was when I spoke with some of you on Maine Street earlier <br />
this week.  You came to Washington from North Carolina, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia at your <br />own expense to affirm just how important this issue is to you.  You made it clear that the Internet is a <br />great equalizer in our society and that average consumers should have the same access to the Internet as <br />those with deep pockets.<br />
There are dozens of examples across the globe where we have seen firsthand the dangers to <br />
society when people are not allowed to choose.  Governments blocking access to content and stifling free <br />speech and public discourse.  <br />
Countries, including some in Europe, where providers have congested or degraded content, and <br />
apps are being blocked from certain mobile devices.  Hints of problems have occurred even here at home, <br />particularly with regard to apps on mobile devices, even though providers in the United State, have been <br />subject to net neutrality principles and rules with the threat of enforcement for over a decade. <br />
So, to Mom and to all of you, this is an issue about promoting our democratic values of free <br />
speech, competition, economic growth, and civic engagement.  <br />
<p><b>The second she posed was, can providers just do what they want?</b></p>  The short answer, is yes.  <br />
As of January we have no rules to prevent discrimination or blocking.<br />
  <br />This is actually a significant change because the FCC has had policies in place dating back to <br />
2004, when the Commission under former Chairman, and my friend Michael Powell, unanimously <br />adopted four principles of an open Internet in the Internet Policy Statement.  These principles became the <br />rules of the road with the potential for enforcement.  Then, in 2010, the Commission formally adopted <br />rules to promote an open Internet by preventing blocking, and unreasonable discrimination. <br />
When the Commission approved these rules, I explained why I would have done some things <br />
differently.  For instance, I would have applied the same rules to both fixed and mobile broadband; <br />prohibited paid priority agreements; limited any exceptions to the rule; and I am on record as preferring a <br />different legal structure.  The 2010 rules reflect a compromise… yes, Mom, I do compromise at times.  <br />But in January 2014, the D.C. Circuit disagreed with our legal framework … so here we are, again.<br />
And I say again, that the court decision means that today we have no unreasonable discrimination <br />
or no blocking rules on the books.  Nothing prevents providers from acting in small ways that largely may <br />go undetected.  And, nothing prevents them from acting in larger ways to discriminate against or even <br />block certain content.  To be fair, providers have stated that they intend, for the time being, not to do so <br />and have publicly committed to retain their current policies of openness.  But, for me, the issue comes <br />down to whether broadband providers should have the ability to determine, on their own, whether the <br />Internet is free and open OR whether we should have basic and clear rules of the road in place to ensure <br />that this occurs as we have had for the last decade.  <br />

<A name=91></a><p><b>Federal Communications Commission</b></p>
<p><b>FCC 14-61</b></p>
And, this may be surprising to some but I have chosen to view the court decision in a positive <br />
light for it has given us a unique opportunity to take a fresh look and evaluate our policy in light of the <br />developments that have occurred in the market over the last four years, including the increased use of <br />WiFi, deployment of LTE, faster speeds and connections to homes, schools, libraries, and the increased <br />use of broadband on mobile devices, to name a few.  The remand enables us to issue this clarion call to <br />the public where they can once again help us answer that most important question of how to protect and <br />maintain a free and open Internet. That ability officially begins for everyone today.<br />
<p><b>The third question, and, judging by the headlines and subsequent reactions, my Mother is </b></p>
<b>in good company here, was “has, it, passed?”</b>  No, it has not, but let me explain.  Some press accounts <br />have reported that the Chairman’s initial proposal is what we are voting on, and have conflated proposed <br />rules with, final rules.  Neither is accurate.<br />
For those who practice in this space, I ask that you bear with me for a moment. When the <br />
Chairman circulates an item, it is indeed a reflection of his vision.  My office then evaluates the proposal, <br />listens to any concerns voiced by interested parties, including consumers, then considers whether we have <br />concerns and, if so, what changes we want to request so that we could move to a position of support.  <br />
This item was no different.  It is true. I too had significant concerns about the initial proposal but <br />
after interactions among the staff, my office, and the Chairman’s office, this item has changed <br />considerably over the last few weeks and I greatly appreciate the Chairman incorporating my many <br />requests to do so.  Though I still may have preferred to make portions of the draft more neutral, what we <br />are voting on today asks about a number of alternatives, which will allow for a well-rounded record to <br />develop, on how best to protect the public interest. <br />
Second, today, we are voting only on proposed rules – not final rules.  Again, this item is an <br />
official call inviting interested parties to comment, to discuss the pros and cons of various approaches, <br />and to have a robust dialogue about the best path forward.  When the Chairman hits the gavel after votes <br />are cast on this item this morning, it will signal the start of 120 unique days of opportunity each of you <br />has in shaping and influencing the direction of one of the world’s most incredible platforms.  The <br />feedback up until now has been nothing short of astounding but the real call to action begins after this <br />vote is taken. Comments are due on July 15th, and there is ample time to evaluate any of the proposals and <br />provide meaningful feedback.  <br />
You have spoken and I am listening.  Your power will never be underestimated, and I sincerely <br />
hope that your passion continues. As I said to those I met with outside of FCC headquarters, this is your <br />opportunity to formally make your point on the record.  You have the ear of the entire FCC.  The eyes of <br />the world are on all of us. Use your voice and this platform to continue to be heard.<br />
I will do all that I can independently, and with the Chairman, to identify ways to encourage a <br />
more interactive dialogue with all stakeholders whether through town halls, workshops, webinars, or <br />social media because I know with a robust record this Commission will be able move quickly and get to <br />the finish line with the adoption of permanent rules that provide certainty, and which are clear and <br />enforceable.  <br />
So, mom, I hope that answers most of your questions and I sincerely hope that you won’t feel <br />
compelled to ask me any more significant policy questions for another 16 years.<br />
In all seriousness, I want to thank the dedicated staff from the Office of General Counsel, <br />
including Jonathan Sallet and Stephanie Weiner, as well as the Wireline Competition and Wireless <br />Telecommunications Bureaus, for their work on this significant item.  And I want to especially thank my <br />Wireline Legal Advisor, Rebekah Goodheart, for her expert work on this item. <br />

<p><b>CONCURRING STATEMENT OF</b></p>
<p><b>COMMISSIONER JESSICA ROSENWORCEL</b></p>
Re:<br />
<i>Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet</i>, GN Docket No. 14-28.<br />
I support an open Internet.  But I would have done this differently.  Before proceeding, I would <br />
have taken time to understand the future.  Because the future of the Internet is the future of everything.  <br />There is nothing in our commercial and civic lives that will be untouched by its influence or unmoved by <br />its power.  I would have taken time for more input.  Because I think as public servants we have a duty to <br />acknowledge and respond to the great tide of public commentary that followed in the wake of the <br />Chairman’s proposal.  Even now, the phone calls continue, the e-mails pour in, and the web itself is <br />ablaze with commentary on how this Commission should proceed.  <br />
It’s no wonder.  Our Internet economy is the envy of the world.  We invented it.  The broadband <br />
below us and the airwaves all around us deliver its collective might to our homes and businesses in <br />communities across the country.  The applications economy began here—on our shores.  What produced <br />this dynamic engine of entrepreneurship and experimentation is a foundation of openness.  Sustaining <br />what has made us innovative, fierce, and creative should not be a choice—it should be an obligation.  <br />
As we proceed, we are also obligated to protect what has made the Internet the most dynamic <br />
platform for free speech ever invented.  It is our modern town square.  It is our printing press.  It is our <br />shared platform for opportunity.  Online we are sovereign—we can choose, create, and consume content <br />unimpeded by the preferences of our broadband providers.  Sustaining this freedom is essential.  <br />
As we proceed, we also must keep front of mind the principles of fairness and protection from <br />
discrimination that have informed every proceeding involving the Internet that has been before this <br />agency. These are the essential values in our communications laws.  They are the ones we have honored <br />in the past; they must guide us in the future.  So going forward we must honor transparency, ban <br />blocking, and prevent unreasonable discrimination. We cannot have a two-tiered Internet, with fast lanes <br />that speed the traffic of the privileged and leave the rest of us lagging behind.  <br />
So I support network neutrality.  But I believe the process that got us to this rulemaking today is <br />
flawed.  I would have preferred a delay.  I think we moved too fast to be fair.  So I concur.  But I want to <br />acknowledge that the Chairman has made significant adjustments to the text of the rulemaking we adopt <br />today.  He has expanded its scope and put all options on the table.  Our effort now covers law and policy, <br />Section 706 and Title II.  <br />
If past is prologue, the future of this proceeding, the future of network neutrality, and the future of <br />
the Internet is still being written.  I am hopeful that we can write it together—and I am mindful that we <br />must get it right.  <br />

<p><b>DISSENTING STATEMENT OF</b></p>
<p><b>COMMISSIONER AJIT PAI</b></p>
Re:<br />
<i>Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet</i>, GN Docket No. 14-28.<br />
A few years ago, Google’s then-CEO, Eric Schmidt, was quoted as saying:  “The Internet is the <br />
first thing that humanity has built that humanity doesn’t understand.”1  If that is so, every American who <br />cares about the future of the Internet should be wary about five unelected officials deciding its fate.<br />
After the U.S. Court of Appeals here in Washington struck down the agency’s latest attempt to <br />
regulate broadband providers’ network management practices,2 I recommended that the Commission seek <br />guidance from Congress instead of plowing ahead yet again on its own.  In my view, recent events have <br />only confirmed the wisdom of that approach.<br />
Let’s start by acknowledging the obvious:  The Chairman’s proposal has sparked a vigorous <br />
public debate.  But we should not let that debate obscure some important common ground: namely, a <br />bipartisan consensus in favor of a free and open Internet.  Indeed, this consensus reaches back at least a <br />decade.  In 2004, then-FCC Chairman Michael Powell outlined four principles of Internet freedom:  The <br />freedom to access lawful content, the freedom to use applications, the freedom to attach personal devices <br />to the network, and the freedom to obtain service plan information.3  One year later, the FCC <br />unanimously endorsed these principles when it adopted the <i>Internet Policy Statement</i>.4<br />
Respect for these four Internet freedoms has aided the Internet’s tremendous growth over the last <br />
decade.  It has shielded online competitors from anticompetitive practices.  It has fostered long-term <br />investments in broadband infrastructure.  It has made the Internet an unprecedented platform for civic <br />engagement, commerce, entertainment, and more.  And it has made the United States the epicenter of <br />online innovation.  I support the four Internet freedoms, and I am committed to protecting them going <br />forward.<br />
It’s not news that people of good faith disagree when it comes to the best way to maintain a free <br />
and open Internet—or as I think of it, how best to preserve the four Internet freedoms for consumers.  <br />Some would like to regulate broadband providers as utilities under Title II of the Communications Act.  <br />This turn to common-carrier regulation would scrap the Clinton-era decision to let the Internet grow and <br />thrive free from price regulation and other obligations applicable to telephone carriers.5<br />
There are others—and I am one of them—who believe President Clinton and Congress got it right <br />
in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 when they declared the policy of the United States to be <br />“preserv[ing] the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet . . . <i>unfettered <br /></i>                                                     <br />

<i>by Federal or State regulation</i>.”6  They think that we should recognize the benefits made possible by the <br />regulatory regime that has been in place for most of the last decade.  After all, nobody thinks of plain old <br />telephone service or utilities as cutting-edge.  But everyone recognizes that the Internet has boundless <br />potential.  And that’s because government didn’t set the bounds early on.<br />
Today’s item strikes yet a third approach.  It’s a lawyerly one that proposes a minimal-level-of-<br />
access rule and a not-too-much-discrimination rule.  It also allows for paid prioritization under <br />unspecified circumstances.  To date, no one outside the building has asked me to support this proposal.  It <br />brings to mind a Texas politician’s observation that there is nothing in the middle of the road but yellow <br />stripes and dead armadillos.<br />
Nothing less than the future of the Internet depends on how we resolve this disagreement.  What <br />
we do will imperil or preserve Internet freedom.  It will promote or deter broadband deployment to rural <br />consumers and infrastructure investment throughout our nation.  It will brighten or hamper the future of <br />innovation both within networks and at their edge.  It will determine whether control of the Internet will <br />reside with the U.S. government or the private sector.  It will impact whether consumers are connected by <br />smart networks or dumb pipes.  And it will advance or undermine American advocacy on the <br />international stage for an Internet free from government control.<br />
A dispute this fundamental is not for us, five unelected individuals, to decide.  Instead, it should <br />
be resolved by the people’s elected representatives, those who choose the direction of government—and <br />those whom the American people can hold accountable for that choice.<br />
I am therefore disappointed that today, rather than turning to Congress, we have chosen to take <br />
matters into our own hands.  It is all the more disappointing because we have been down this road before.  <br />Our prior two attempts to go it alone ended in court defeats.  Even with the newfangled tools the FCC will <br />try to pull out of its legal grab-bag, I am skeptical that the third time will be the charm.<br />
<i>For one</i>, I see no legal path for the FCC to prohibit paid prioritization or the development of a <br />
two-sided market—which appears to be the <i>sine qua non </i>objection by many to the Chairman’s proposal.  <br />As the NPRM frankly acknowledges, section 706 of the Telecommunications Act “could not be used” for <br />such a ban.7  And while the NPRM resists saying it outright, neither could Title II.  After all, Title II only <br />authorizes the FCC to prohibit “unjust or unreasonable discrimination”8 and both the Commission and the <br />courts have consistently interpreted that provision to allow carriers to charge different prices for different <br />services.9  Indeed, I have been unable to find even a single case in which the Commission found it <br />unlawfully discriminatory to offer a different (faster) service to customers at a different (higher) price.<br />

<i>For another</i>, the legal consequences of moving forward with net-neutrality regulation are sure to <br />
wreak havoc on the Internet economy, no matter which legal path we take.  If we are to take the D.C. <br />Circuit at its word, section 706 grants the FCC virtually unfettered authority to encourage broadband <br />adoption and deployment.10  So if three members of the FCC think that more Americans would go online <br />if they knew their information would be secure, could we impose cybersecurity and encryption standards <br />on website operators?  If three members of the FCC think that more Americans would purchase <br />broadband if edge providers were prohibited from targeted advertising, could we impose Do Not Track <br />regulations?  Or if three members of the FCC think that more Americans would use the Internet if there <br />were greater privacy protections, could we follow the European Union and impose right-to-be-forgotten <br />mandates?  And because section 706 gives state commissions authority equal to the FCC,11 every <br />broadband provider, every online innovator, every Internet-enabled entrepreneur may now have to <br />comply with differing regulations in each of the 50 states.  Tesla, Uber, Airbnb, and countless others can <br />attest to the welcome that parochial regulators give to disruptive start-ups.<br />
The Internet would fare no better under Title II, and the consequences are likely to be even worse.  <br />
Reclassification opens the door to actual access charges—tariffed charges that Internet service providers <br />could impose on edge providers, content delivery networks, and transit operators <i>without their consent</i>.  <br />Indeed, one Title II option on the table would guarantee new Internet tolls by giving broadband ISPs no <br />option other than access charges to recover their regulated costs.12  Not only that, but reclassification <br />means a broadband price hike for every consumer in America—not exactly a move that will encourage <br />broadband adoption.13  And alongside tariffed access charges and higher consumer prices, other Title II <br />provisions—ranging from the disclosure of customer information14 to mandatory billing disclosures15—<br />would apply to broadband providers, edge providers, or really anyone in the Internet economy.  And like <br />section 706, Title II puts state regulators on par with the FCC, meaning there may be 50 sets of access <br />charges to be paid, 50 different broadband fees to be assessed, 50 different privacy regimes to be <br />complied with, and 50 different types of mandatory disclosures to be made.  As this suggests, a Title II <br />regime hardly lowers the barriers to competitive entry—starting a company doesn’t get you free legal <br />services.  And it would hardly “provide certainty to all market participants and keep the costs of <br />regulation low,” as 150 Internet companies asked us to do last week.16<br />
<i>Finally</i>, pursuing net-neutrality regulations under section 706 or Title II places in jeopardy every <br />
other goal of this Commission in the communications marketplace.  Most obviously, this pursuit injects <br />tremendous regulatory uncertainty into the market, chilling further broadband deployment,17 threatening <br />

the $60 billion a year that private companies invest in their broadband networks, and potentially <br />jeopardizing some of the millions of jobs that depend on such investment.18  This brave new world will <br />deter new entrants and reduce competition in the broadband market.<br />
This is no academic concern.  Even with the cushion of market capitalization equivalent to <br />
Comcast, Verizon, and T-Mobile combined, Google has already attested that our legacy regulations led it <br />not to offer phone service as part of Google Fiber.19  On the other end of the size spectrum, there are <br />thousands of smaller Internet service providers—wireless ISPs (WISPs), small-town cable operators, <br />electric cooperatives, and others—that don’t have the means or the margins to withstand a regulatory <br />onslaught.  If they go dark, consumers they serve (including my parents, who are WISP subscribers in <br />rural Kansas) will be thrown offline.<br />
On top of all this, undertaking such a “politically corrosive” rulemaking on dubious legal and <br />
policy grounds will swamp what should be an independent, expert agency with years of litigation and <br />partisan division.20  That is not good for broadband deployment, that is not good for consumers, and that <br />is not good for future of the Internet.<br />
For all of these reasons, I respectfully dissent.<br />
* * *<br />
Nevertheless, if we are going to act like our own mini-legislature and plunge the Commission into <br />
this morass, we need to use a better process going forward.  I agree with my colleague, Commissioner <br />Rosenworcel, that we have rushed headlong into this rulemaking by holding this vote today21—and when <br />there is any bipartisan agreement on net neutrality, that’s something to pay attention to.  We have seen <br />over the past month what happens when the American people feel excluded from the Commission’s <br />deliberations.  Indeed, on several recent issues, many say that the Commission has spent too much time <br />speaking at the American people and not enough time listening to them.<br />
Going forward, we need to give the American people a full and fair opportunity to participate in <br />
this process.  And we must ensure that our decisions are based on a robust record.<br />
So what is the way forward?  Here’s one suggestion.  Just as we commissioned a series of <br />
economic studies in past media-ownership proceedings,22 we should ask ten distinguished economists <br />from across the country to study the impact of our proposed regulations and alternative approaches on the <br />Internet ecosystem.  To ensure that we obtain a wide range of perspectives, let each Commissioner pick <br />two authors.  To ensure accuracy, each study should be peer reviewed.  And to ensure public oversight, <br />

we should host a series of hearings where Commissioners could question the authors of the studies and <br />the authors of those studies could discuss their differences.  Surely the future of the Internet is no less <br />important than media ownership.<br />
But we should not limit ourselves to economic studies.  We should also engage computer <br />
scientists, technologists, and other technical experts to tell us how they see the Internet’s infrastructure <br />and consumers’ online experience evolving.  Their studies too should be subject to peer review and public <br />hearings.<br />
Ultimately, any decisions we make on Internet regulation must be based on sound engineering <br />
and an accurate understanding of how networks actually function.  They should be informed by the <br />judicious and successful regulatory approach embraced by both Democrats and Republicans in recent <br />years.  And they should avoid embroiling everyone, from the FCC to industry to the average American <br />consumer, in yet another years-long legal waiting game.<br />
In short, getting the future of the Internet right is more important than getting this done right now.  <br />
After all, the Internet was free and open before the FCC’s net-neutrality rules took effect in November <br />2011.  And it is still free and open today even though those rules are no longer in force.  Going forward, I <br />hope that we will not rush headlong into enacting bad rules.  We are not confronted with an immediate <br />crisis that requires immediate action.  And if we are going to usurp Congress’s role and make <br />fundamental policy choices for the American people, we must do better than the process that led to <br />today’s vote.<br />

<p><b>DISSENTING STATEMENT OF </b></p>
<p><b>COMMISSIONER MICHAEL O’RIELLY</b></p>
Re:<br />
<i>Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet, </i>GN Docket No. 14-28.<br />
It should come as no surprise that I cannot support today’s Notice.  As I’ve said before, the <br />
premise for imposing net neutrality rules is fundamentally flawed and rests on a faulty foundation of <br />make-believe statutory authority.  I have serious concerns that this ill-advised item will create damaging <br />uncertainty and head the Commission down a slippery slope of regulation.  <br />
As anticipated, the Notice proposes to ground the net neutrality rules in section 706 of the <br />
Telecommunications Act of 1996.  I have already expressed my views that Congress never intended <br />section 706 to be an affirmative grant of authority to the Commission to regulate the Internet.  At most, it <br />could be used to trigger <i>deregulation</i>.  <br />
But the Notice doesn’t stop there.  It seeks comment on ways to construe additional language in <br />
section 706 and even suggests using section 230(b) to broaden the scope of the Commission’s usurped <br />authority.  This is absurd.  I was worried enough that the Commission’s current reading of section 706 <br />could be used to justify any number of regulatory interventions and could ultimately impact not just <br />broadband providers, but also edge providers.  Now that the Commission is trying to cast an even wider <br />net of authority, I fear that other services and providers could become ensnared in the future.  <br />
And just in case section 706 proves to be inadequate for this regulatory boondoggle, the Notice <br />
explores upending years of precedent and investment by reclassifying broadband Internet access as a Title <br />II service.  That is, the Commission examines applying monopoly era telephone rules to modern <br />broadband services solely to impose unnecessary and defective net neutrality regulations.  I cannot <br />support such a backward-looking, ends-driven approach—not in a Notice and certainly not in final rules.       <br />
While courts can recognize that an agency may <i>legally </i>reverse course as long as it adequately <br />
explains the reasons for changing its position, I am concerned about the <i>real world impact </i>that such a <br />decision could have on the communications industry and the economy as a whole.  The current <br />framework has provided a climate of certainty and stability for broadband investment and Internet <br />innovation.  Upending that framework could disrupt the tremendous progress that has been made over the <br />last decade.  I also worry about the credibility of an agency that consistently fails to meet statutory <br />deadlines to review and eliminate old rules, but is supposedly open to reapplying obsolete provisions.  <br />
The Notice suggests that reclassification could be accompanied by substantial forbearance from <br />
the Title II requirements.  But the need to forbear from a significant number of provisions in Title II <br />proves the point that Title II is an inappropriate framework for today’s dynamic technologies.  Indeed, <br />Title II includes a host of arcane provisions on topics like interlocking directorates, valuation of carrier <br />property, uniform system of accounts and depreciation charges, telephone operator services, <br />telemessaging service, Bell Operating Company entry into interLATA services, manufacturing of <br />telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment, and electronic publishing.  Even if the <br />Commission granted forbearance from all of the provisions that it has eliminated for incumbent telephone <br />companies—and then some—advocates are ignoring that broadband providers and services would still be <br />subject to a host of unnecessary rules.  The idea that the Commission can magically impose or sprinkle <br />just the right amount of Title II on broadband providers is giving the Commission more credit than it ever <br />deserves.  <br />
Additionally, before taking any action on any issue, the Commission should have specific and <br />
verifiable evidence that there is a market failure.  The Notice does not examine the broadband market <br />much less identify any failures.  A true and accurate review of the U.S. broadband market—which must <br />
98<br />
<hr>
<A name=99></a><p><b>Federal Communications Commission</b></p>
<p><b>FCC 14-61</b></p>
include wireless broadband—would show how dynamic it is.  The Notice does acknowledge that <br />innovation and investment have flourished, although it implausibly ascribes those successes to the vacated <br />net neutrality rules.    <br />
Moreover, the Notice fails to make the case that there’s an actual problem resulting in real harm <br />
to consumers.  The Notice identifies, at most, two additional examples of alleged harm.  And in one <br />instance, the Commission concedes it did not find a violation.  The Notice tries to explain away the <br />absence of net neutrality complaints, but the unpersuasive excuses cannot mask a lack of evidence.  In a <br />last ditch attempt to find problems, the Notice points to supposed bad conduct occurring outside of the <br />United States without explaining how that is relevant to a very different U.S. broadband market and <br />regulatory structure.<br />
Having come up empty handed, the Notice proceeds to explore hypothetical concerns.  At the top <br />
of the list is prioritization.  But even ardent supporters of net neutrality recognize that some amount of <br />traffic differentiation or “prioritization” must be allowed or even encouraged. Voice must be prioritized <br />over email; video over plain data. Prioritization is not a bad word. It is a necessary component of <br />reasonable network management.  <br />
The Notice is particularly skeptical of paid prioritization and contemplates banning some or all <br />
such arrangements outright.  Yet companies that do business over the Internet, including some of the <br />strongest supporters of net neutrality, routinely pay for a variety of services to ensure the best possible <br />experience for their consumers.  They’ve been doing it for years.  And certain arrangements have even <br />been viewed as “good for the Internet.”  In short, fears that paid prioritization will automatically degrade <br />service for other users, relegating them to a so-called “slow lane,” have been disproven by years of <br />experience.  <br />
Because there’s no evidence of actual harm that could help inform the proposed rules, they are <br />
not narrowly tailored but hopelessly vague and unclear.  We are left to puzzle over what it means to <br />provide a “minimum level of access” or what constitutes a “commercially unreasonable” practice, <br />especially in the absence of contractual relationships.  The Notice suggests that providers could seek non-<br />binding staff guidance or prospective reviews of their practices.  But it is very troubling when legitimate <br />companies are put in the position of having to ask the government for its blessing every time they need to <br />make a business decision in order to avoid costly enforcement or litigation. It is even more telling that the <br />Commission is suggesting new layers of enforcement options for which it has no experience.  For <br />instance, where are ombudsmen mentioned in the statute and what are they to do exactly?      <br />
Finally, to say the cost-benefit “analysis” is woefully inadequate is an understatement.  The <br />
Notice devotes several pages to a wish list of disclosures, reporting requirements, and certifications that <br />will impose new burdens and carry real costs, but may not even be meaningful to end users.  For example, <br />what will the average consumer do with information on packet corruption and jitter?  However, there is <br />no attempt to quantify and compare the costs of the proposed new requirements against the supposed <br />benefits—just a single paragraph seeking comment on ways to reduce the burdens.  Proposed rules should <br />be accompanied by a fulsome cost-benefit analysis that includes a detailed and extensive review of <br />current law, especially as it applies to other federal agencies that we seek to imitate.  The Commission’s <br />short-shrift approach to cost-benefit analysis cannot continue, and I intend to spend time improving this <br />important function.  <br />
In sum, the proposed net neutrality rules and legal theories will stifle innovation and investment <br />
by the private sector, provide no help to consumers, and thrust the Commission into a place it shouldn’t <br />be.  I respectfully dissent.<br />
